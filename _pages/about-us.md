Hi there!

WhatAboutPets is a small but growing blog that tries to help pets and owners live happier lives.

We cover a broad number of topics ranging from fun facts to health tips and ideas.

Our team of part-time editors and writers is really looking forward to bring you informative and well-researched articles.

Every contribution to this blog is always done with the animal's best interests at heart.

We respect and value our readers too much to write anything other than our own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

> With that said, we are not veterinarians. Our tips on health and recommendations should not be used in place of professional advice!

Enjoy reading!

The WhatAboutPets team.
