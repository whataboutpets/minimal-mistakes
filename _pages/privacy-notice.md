## Disclosure Policy

We make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because we'll get a percentage of that sale.

Currently, we are an affiliate for Amazon and Google Adsense.

What this means for you:

* We became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where we have direct control over which ads are served on this website we offer only products that are directly related to the topic of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.
* We do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money.
* We do not let the compensation we receive influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
* We respect and value our readers too much to write anything other than our own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

Just like this website, our Privacy Notice is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.
