[Bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread){:target="_blank"} is prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. It has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods.

# Do Ducks Eat Bread?

Rabbits tend to have a taste for sweet food and will really like to eat fresh fruit as occasional treats. Apples can be considered as a **safe and harmless fruit choice** for rabbits.

They are, however [high in calories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#Nutrition){:target="_blank"} as they contain lots of sugar, so make sure to **keep the quantity of this treat to a minimum**. Note that if your rabbit already has a weight problem, it is best to avoid feeding any type of fruit, including apples.

If it is the first time you offer an apple to your rabbit, it is best to **introduce the new food slowly** in order to allow the digestive system to adjust. Leave a couple of days between offering another apple and keep a watch on the stools. If you see the droppings get soft, stop the introduction and try again after some time.

Before feeding the apple, make sure to **rinse it with clear running water** in order to remove contaminations. A good way to serve the apple to your rabbit is by cutting it up into smaller pieces.

As mentioned keep the portions small. For instance, a **couple of slices per rabbit per day**.

# Can Rabbits Eat Apple Peels?

If you are wondering whether rabbits can also eat the skin of the apple then the answer is yes. The peel actually [packs most of the fibers and vitamins](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/19/never-peel-apple_n_4791328.html){:target="_blank"} that an apple contains.

> Next time you are making an apple pie, don't throw away those skins but keep them as a treat.

# Can Rabbits Eat Apple Seeds?

When offering apples to your bunny, **make sure to remove the seeds**. The reason for this is that apple seeds contain [amygdalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#Toxicity_of_seeds){:target="_blank"}, a sugar and cyanide compound.

This toxic substance is only present in very small quantities and as such, there is no reason to panic in case your rabbit has accidentally swallowed some seeds. The greater concern would be continuous consumption where the amygdalin was progressively building up in your rabbit's system to the point of reaching toxic levels.

**Conclusion:** Yes, rabbits can eat apples and their skin, but not the seeds!
