Before feeding them to ducks, our advice is to **cut the grapes in half** as this will make consumption easier.

When looking for a healthy alternative to bread, grapes are a good choice for feeding both domesticated and wild ducks.

Preferably combine the grapes with other treats and **exercise portion control**.
