Ever wondered whether bread is bad for ducks? What about fish, vegetables, fruits, snacks or even food from other pets? In order to help you decide, we have compiled a list of different food items and whether it is a good idea to offer them to ducks or not.

*Disclaimer*{:.underline}: the list below is by no means exhaustive. **If you're unsure** about feeding a duck a certain type of food, our best advice is to **just don't do it**. In addition, when doing our research, we noticed that a number of the below items are up for debate. So if you know something we haven't mentioned please let us know in the comments section below.

## What Does a Duck Eat?

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/ducks/ducks-eating-seeds.jpg" alt="ducks eating seeds" class="align-right">

Before diving into specific food items, there are some basic duck feeding aspects we would like to mention. In general, the best foods for ducks are those that provide the **nutrients, minerals and vitamins** a duck needs for healthy growth and development. Most of these foods are actually similar to what [wild ducks will forage on their own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck#Feeding){:target="_blank"} (grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, ...).

Most of the food items mentioned below are to be considered as **treats and should be limited to no more than 5-10% of a duck's daily diet**. This is especially true for ducklings as birds grow much faster than for example we humans do. Without proper nutrition, [problems can and will occur](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/kind_news/2015/02-03/feeding-ducks-and-geese-can-be-harmful.html){:target="_blank"}.

A last important item we want to mention is that [a duck's digestive system works quite different from our own](http://www.ducks.org/hunting/understanding-waterfowl-duck-digestion){:target="_blank"}. Because of this, it is important for domesticated ducks to have access to **fresh drinking water and grit** (coarse dirt, pebbles or stones) as this helps them to digest their food.

So what can ducks eat? Let's dive into the list!

## Can Ducks Eat Bread? - *Nope*{:.red}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/bread.jpg" alt="bread" class="align-right">

This is the most searched, but also one of the most debated questions we have encountered. And you might be surprised to see that we advise against feeding ducks bread.

After all, haven't we all seen people giving leftover bread crumbs to ducks at a local river or pond. Chances are you've even done this yourself. So why is bread bad for ducks?

Bread is actually a good source of carbohydrates but other than that it offers **little nutritional value** for ducks. Eating a lot of bread will make a duck overweight and can even lead to malnutrition. Offered in extreme moderation, bread is not harmful to ducks but especially for wild ducks that moderation is very hard to judge.

Feeding ducks bread can also lead to a number of other problems. Uneaten bread in water can cause **algal blooms**, which in turn [can affect water life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom#Freshwater_algal_blooms){:target="_blank"} and cause plants and fish to die off. Moldy decayed bread can lead to **diseases** among ducks that in some cases can even be fatal. And young ducklings are especially sensitive to **not getting the right nutrition** for healthy growth from a diet of mostly bread.

Our advice is to **offer ducks healthier alternatives instead of bread**. If you are wondering what these alternatives might be, feel free to scroll down further on this page to discover some healthy duck treats.

## Can Ducks Eat Popcorn? - *Nope*{:.red}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/popcorn.jpg" alt="popcorn" class="align-right">

Sure ducks can eat popcorn, as long as you take them to the pictures first :-)

All joking aside you won't be surprised to see that we are advising not to give ducks popcorn. The reason is actually very similar to the ones we mentioned for bread.

For ducks, it's important to have a balanced diet in order to avoid **malnutrition and growth problems**. Most popcorn is produced in such a way that it doesn't contain any nutritional value other than carbohydrates. Manufactures add butter, sugar, salt and other chemicals to enhance flavor but this comes at the cost of extra calories.

As wild ducks often feed in areas where they are threatened by predators, they have adapted to be able to "feed and run". As a consequence, they have extra storage capacity in the part between throat and stomach, called esophagus. Some people mention that [popcorn is harder for ducks to swallow](https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-you-supposed-to-feed-ducks-popcorn){:target="_blank"} as the kernels could get snagged in their esophagus and potentially lead to choking or abrasions.

In short, don't feed popcorn to ducks and opt for some healthier choices as given below.

## Can Ducks Eat Grapes? - *In Moderation*{:.blue}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/grapes.jpg" alt="grapes" class="align-right">

Grapes are a type of fruit that come in a number of colors. They are grown all over the world and aside being used for wine production they are a popular between-meal snack for us humans.

A grape is a great source of **natural sugar** and a great treat for ducks when given in moderation. Before feeding them to ducks, our advice is to **cut the grapes in half** as this will make consumption easier.

When looking for a healthy alternative to bread, grapes are a good choice for feeding both domesticated and wild ducks. But remember to combine with other treats and **exercise portion control**!

## Can Ducks Eat Chocolate? - *Nope*{:.red}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/chocolate.jpg" alt="chocolate" class="align-right">

Chocolate is a food preparation which is made from roasted and ground cacao beans. It is typically sweetened and eaten as [confectionery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery){:target="_blank"} or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods.

Chocolate contains substances called **theobromine and caffeine** which come from the cacao bean. The cocoa trees load up the cocoa beans with these substances in order to [protect the cacao bean from being eaten](http://www.amanochocolate.com/articles/how-much-caffeine-is-in-chocolate/){:target="_blank"}. While our human body is capable of detoxifying and removing theobromine and caffeine, to insects and wildlife, these substances can actually be toxic.

Theobromine and caffeine originate from the cacao bean. As a general rule, **the more cacao the chocolate contains** (typically the darker chocolate), **the more dangerous** it is for certain animals.

Dogs and cats are well known pets that are susceptible to [chocolate poisoning](http://askdrlouise.com/blog/the-dark-side-of-chocolate/){:target="_blank"}. But chocolate is also **toxic to livestock like calves, goats and ducks**. In a first stage, the digestive system is affected, leading to vomiting and diarrhea. As the condition progresses, the central nervous system is impacted, first causing seizures and eventually death.

Bottom line, **never feed ducks chocolate**.
