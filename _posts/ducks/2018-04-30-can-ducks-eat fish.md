All [Fish](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/){:target="_blank"} have two things in common: they live in water and they have a backbone (they are [vertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate){:target="_blank"}). Fish have been around on our planet for more than 500 million years and can be found in nearly all aquatic environments.

# Do Ducks Eat Fish?

Ducks are [omnivorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore){:target="_blank"} birds that feed on a wide variety of food sources. As most wild ducks live around water, they often feed on aquatic plants or animals, including fish.

The fish eating habbits actually depend on the [type of duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck#Feeding){:target="_blank"}. Dabbling ducks for example can only reach under water without completely submerging and thus limiting their fish catching ability. Diving ducks and sea ducks can forage deep underwater. There are even a few specialized species that are adapted to catch and swallow large fish.
