All [Fish](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/){:target="_blank"} have two things in common: they live in water and they have a backbone (they are [vertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate){:target="_blank"}). Fish have been around on our planet for more than 500 million years and can be found in nearly all aquatic environments.

# Do Ducks Eat Fish?

Ducks are [omnivorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore){:target="_blank"} birds that feed on a wide variety of food sources. As most wild ducks live around water, they often feed on aquatic plants or animals, including fish and their eggs.

The fish-eating habits actually depend on the [type of duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck#Feeding){:target="_blank"}.

Dabbling ducks, for example, can only reach underwater without completely submerging and thus limiting their catching ability. Diving ducks and sea ducks can forage deep underwater. There are even a few specialized species that are adapted to catch and swallow large fish.

If you are raising ducks you can get live [feeder fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeder_fish){:target="_blank"} from your local pet store. There are a number of types available ranging from feeder goldfish, minnows, to guppies.

**Conclusion:** yes, ducks eat fish, some will be better at catching them than others.
