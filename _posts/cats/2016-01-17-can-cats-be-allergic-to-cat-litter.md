Like people, our feline friends can also develop allergies. And like people, the source of these allergies can be pretty much anything in their surrounding environment. After you have eliminated the allergy sources that typically spring to mind (pollen from plants or food), chances are you are staring at the kitty litter and are asking yourself the following question: **Can my cat be allergic to litter**?

## What Are Cat Litter Allergies?

Cat allergies are caused by an **overreaction of their immune system to one or more substances, also known as allergens**. With most cats, allergens don't trigger an overreaction. However with some cats, their immune system aggressively tries to get rid of these allergens which results in a number of symptoms that we will discuss further below.

Cat litter may contain substances that can act as allergens for certain cats. If the immune system of your feline overreacts to one of these allergens then we can conclude that your cat is allergic to cat litter.

An allergic reaction can occur as an immediate result to an allergen in the cat's presence or it **can develop over time**. In other words, even if your cat has been using the kitty litter for a long time without any allergic response, the allergy could still develop at any given moment.

In addition, it is useful to know that **if your cat is allergic to one allergen, there is a good change she/he might be allergic to other allergens as well**. So if for example you already know that your cat is allergic to certain types of cat food, changes are that she/he might also be allergic to certain types of cat litter.
