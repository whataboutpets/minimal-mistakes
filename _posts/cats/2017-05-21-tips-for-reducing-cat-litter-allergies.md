Coping with a cat litter allergy isn't easy.

In this article, we will show you not just one, but 21 things you can do to reduce or even get rid of those annoying cat litter allergy symptoms.

> Note that treating allergies will differ from person to person and cat to cat. Because of this, we advise you to try out different things and hopefully you will find something that works for both you and your furry friend.

Are you ready? Here we go.

# 1) Change the Type of Cat Litter

Cat litter comes in a variety of materials. Litter made out of clay will in most cases generate dust which is a well known [allergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen). On top of that clay can attract dust mites, another allergen source. Try to stay clear of these clay-based litters and go for the [hypoallergenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoallergenic) varieties.

There are many different types of cat litters on the market, but essentially most of them fall into three distinct categories: clay-based, silica-based, and biodegradable. **The last two tend to produce little to no dust**. 

Scan through the ingredients list located on your cat litter packaging. Non-clumping conventional litters are typically made out of clay. If you are using clumping cat litter there is a high chance it is made from granulated [bentonite clay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentonite). These are the types you probably want to avoid. On the other hand, if you are allergic to the biodegradable types you might want to look for a clay-based litter that is very low on dust.

[Biodegradable litters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_box#Biodegradable_litter) are made from various plant resources, including pine wood pellets, recycled newspaper, corn, wheat, and walnuts. An added advantage that these litters have is that they are much more friendly to the environment.

Silica gel litter is often referred to as "crystal litter". The silica used in these products is similar to the beads packed in a permeable bag that are used as a preservative for goods that can be damaged by excess moisture. Because the granules in this type of litter are not fine, they produce much less dust.

Keep in mind that switching litter might take some time as it is typically a process of trial and error. But don't get discouraged as changing litter is one of the best ways to reduce cat litter allergies.

> Note that this tip might help correct another problem. If your cat stopped using the litter box because she/he is allergic to the litter, switching might just help to get your kitty on the catbox again.

# 2) Check the Location of the Litter Box

Preferably the litter box is placed in a well-ventilated area, but make sure to avoid highly trafficked areas to reduce exposure to the cat litter.

Choose an area like a garage or laundry room that has vents to the outside. On top of keeping dust out, odors can also escape.

Make sure to keep the litter tray away from central air intake vents, as these will spread the dust throughout your home. Having the allergens circulating around your house will probably make things worse.

Avoid rooms where you spend a lot of your time or that you frequent a lot.The main goal is to come into the least amount of contact with the kitty litter.

# 3) Empty the Cat Litter Frequently

Make sure to change the litter often. Keep the box as clean as possible by washing it down at least once a week. This will reduce allergen buildup.

As cat urine and feces can also contain allergens, scoop at least once or twice a day. It's even better if you can get to it as soon as your kitty has made a deposit. There are self-cleaning litter boxes available that use a sensor to tell when a cat has entered and then left the litter box.

Twice a week is a general guideline for replacing litter. Fitting a litter liner in your cat's litter box can help minimize spillage when emptying the box. 

Scrub the box every time you change the litter using a mild dish detergent. Be careful when using stronger cleaning products as they can turn a cat off, and in some cases are toxic to cats.

If possible, have someone in the household who is not allergic scoop or empty the box. Otherwise using a mask and gloves can help minimize allergic reactions.

Emptying the litter is not one of the most fun chores to do around the house. But on the bright side, by regularly changing the cat litter you have the added advantage that the litter box will always smell fresh.

# 4) Wipe or Wash Often

When your kitty uses the catbox, litter material will inevitably end up on paws and fur as cats instinctively try to cover their feces. Wiping or washing your cat will help keep potential allergens on your feline's fur to a minimum.

Frequent baths wash away cat litter allergens on the coat and skin. Make sure to use a cat-friendly shampoo with no scent, and no additives. Look for one that does not dry out your cat's skin.

As bathing is typically very stressful for a cat we recommend that you first apply a flower essence blend to reduce your cat's anxiety. If your cat flips out just let go as a frightened, distressed cat will shred or bite you to get free.

For felines who prefer not to be rinsed in the tub, cat wipes are a good alternative. They might actually be more effective as they can be used on a daily basis and are less stressful for your cat. Wipe from back of the ears to tail, carefully avoiding eyes.

Note that washing also applies to your own hands whenever they have been in contact with the cat litter. Either directly or via your cat's fur.

# 5 ) Try an Air Purifier

As liter dust can occur throughout your home, getting an air purifier for the area that you or your pet are immediately in can actually be a great way to decrease allergens and dust mites.

Even with constant cleaning and vacuuming, it's difficult to keep the air in living spaces clean. An air purifier can be a great way 

Make sure to look for a model that comes with a HEPA air filter. These filters 99.97% the allergens, dust, mold, pollens, and other junk particles out of the air.


are the best kinds of air filters to clean the air of any harmful particles. You can buy these as free-standing units or you can also get some that are attached to the air conditioner.

not just in cat litter.

Dust mites occur throughout the home, not just in cat litter. Try an air purifier with a HEPA filter to reduce dust mites
Clear the air!  Invest in a high efficiency particulate arrestance/air (HEPA) filter. Remember that the cat allergen can linger for long periods of time, so continuously straining it out of the air will reduce your exposure to the allergen.

Use air purifiers throughout the house; look for the ones with HEPA filters. Salt
lamps can help attract dust and cause it to drop to the floor where it can be vacuumed up.
Some purifiers use UV light to kill germs/viruses, as well, which may be an attractive option.

The basic treatment is simple: Don't get too close to the litter material.
Cat litter can be a major source of allergic reactions from dust residue, dust mites, fragrances or chemicals.
Perhaps you know if you're sensitive to dust or to fragrances.
Cat litter is likely not the only problem area for you.
If you're not sure whether it's dust or fragrances causing your allergies, test out different litters until you find one that works well.
Allergic reactions occur when a human or cat's immune system reacts negatively to any number of substances (which are usually harmless), such as pollen, grass, certain grains, etc. Symptoms like sneezing, wheezing or vomiting happen while the body tries to rid itself of those substances (called "allergens").
The best way to treat your cat's allergies is to remove the allergens from his or her environment.







3) Medication

Over-the-counter allergy medications can also help relieve your symptoms.
Your vet can prescribe antihistamines to relieve some of Kitty's symptoms
Your veterinarian may prescribe an antihistamine or cortisone to help alleviate the symptoms that your cat is experiencing. Allergy shots are also available if the litter allergy is severe. Immunotherapy may also be an option for cats that suffer from severe allergies. Once it has been determined that your cat is suffering from litter allergies, your veterinarian may recommend certain litters that do not contain the offending allergens.
Medication is sometimes prescribed for cats in case certain allergens cannot be removed from the environment. Medications include:
-Cortisone, steroids or allergy injections for airborne pollens
-Antihistamines as a preventative
-Flea prevention products



5) Change to non fragrence litter

The fragrance in the litter might be the allergen, so try an unscented litter to see if that helps your kitty.
and highly scented litter tend to cause allergies from the fine particles.
If you use a fragrant litter and suspect fragrance sensitivity, switch to an unscented type.
Also be sure to get rid of any cat litter that is scented or has deodorizers in them. These additives contain a lot of chemicals and are not necessary for cat litter.
Also, avoid dyes, fragrances, and chemically treated litter.
Fragrances are also another popular allergen and frequently found in commercial cat
litters. Avoiding scented litters will cut down on allergens; additionally, many cats are
irritated by strong smells, so using unscented litter will reduce stress on your cat.

Many people use scented litter or air freshener to mask litter box odors, but often times, these odors can be offputting to cats. A thin layer of baking soda placed on the bottom of the box will help absorb odors without repelling your cat. 

7) Wash bedding

and vacuum and wash her bedding regularly to keep discarded litter dust off her fur.

Get a dust mite cover for your mattresses pillows. Use only hypoallergenic
pillows and blankets (synthetic, down alternatives work well; no feathers or down).
Wash bedding weekly, paying particular attention to pet beds and areas your pet likes
to sleep. Use slipcovers on furniture that can be removed and washed.

8) Hypoallergenic

Luckily, litter allergies are easily managed by switching to a hypoallergenic litter, isolating the allergen and taking steps to minimize allergen exposure.
When you use hypoallergenic cat litters, you can be sure that there are no preservatives, toxins, or additives, so you can be virtually guaranteed that your cat will not suffer an allergic reaction from it.
It's all about the type of cat litter you choose. Hanophy advises, "Check ingredients. Also, there are hypoallergenic litters made for cats. "Yesterday's News" is made from paper.  There are also other brands that reduce allergens."



10) Clean often

and clean surfaces including rugs and bedding regularly to reduce dust.
 

12) Change type of litter box

ou may consider switching the type of litter box you are using since ceramic or metal litter boxes will accumulate less dust than the popular plastic litter boxes.

the rule of thumb is at least one more litter box than the number of cats in the house.

Some people prefer to provide their cats with a covered litter box. While covered boxes can increase privacy and  decrease the amount of litter that flies from the box when your cat buries their business, there are some potential downsides. An "out of sight, out of mind" little box is easy to forget about, which may lead to a dirty box with odors trapped inside (which is even less likely to be appealing to your cat). Covered boxes can also be difficult for larger cats to turn around and position themselves in, and may lead to easier ambushes upon exit.

13) Cat free bedroom

Make your bedroom a cat-free zone. This means wash or, better yet, replace your bedding. Allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers are highly recommended and can be purchased at most home stores.

14) Limit the domain

Limit kitty's domain. Establish designated areas where your cat can travel within your house. Keep your cat away from your workstations by closing doors, for example. Make sure to supply plenty of cozy, warm places in kitty-approved areas.

15) Decorate wisely

Decorate wisely. Minimizing upholstered furniture and rugs or carpeting can vastly reduce the amount of allergen buildup in your home. Carpeting, in particular, can accumulate 100 times as many allergens as hardwood floors.

16) Brush your cat outside

Brush your cat outside!  If you have an open-air enclosure, use this space to brush your cat, so allergen-laden dander can disperse and blow away, rather than accumulating in your home.


17) Replace carpeting

If possible, replace carpeting with hard wood, tile, or linoleum floor; carpeting
can trap dust and other allergens.

18) Sprays

Use sprays to kill dust mites and neutralize allergens. Bissell, Febreeze, and
Nature's Miracle are among the companies that produce commercial sprays that kill
dust mites and/or neutralize allergens.

19) Look at the whole picture





Designate your bedroom as a cat-free zone. Begin your program of allergen reduction by washing bedding, drapes and pillows. Better yet, replace them. Use plastic covers that are designed to prevent allergens from penetrating on your mattress and pillows. Allergen-proof covers are available from medical supply outlets. Don't expect results overnight. Cat allergens are one-sixth the size of pollens, and it may take months to reduce them significantly.

Restrict your cat's access to designated areas inside your home. If you have a safe outdoor enclosure, allow your cat some time outside where dander will waft away in the wind. Brush your cat in the fresh-air enclosure to prevent loose, allergen-carrying hair from dispersing through your home.

Eliminate allergen traps such as upholstered furniture and rugs. Carpet can accumulate up to 100 times the amount of cat allergens as hardwood flooring, so replacing the wall-to-wall with wood will keep allergens from accumulating as much. If ripping up the carpet is not an option, have it steam cleaned as often as needed.

Vacuuming blows as many allergens through the air as it removes, so when you vacuum, use an allergen-proof vacuum cleaner bag or a vacuum cleaner with a high efficiency particulate arresting (HEPA) filter.

Get some fresh air. Highly insulated homes trap allergens as well as heat, so open the windows to increase the ventilation in your home, and run window fans on exhaust. (But remember to always screen windows so kitty stays safely indoors.) Also, clean the air inside your home. Although nothing will remove all of the allergens present, running an air cleaner with a HEPA filter will help.



Spray allergens away. Anti-allergen sprays are a convenient way to deactivate allergens, including those produced by pets. Allersearch ADS, made from plant-based, non-toxic substances, can be sprayed throughout the house to take the sting out of household dust by rendering allergens harmless.



Take your medicine. Over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines, decongestants, eye drops and aerosol inhalers will help reduce the symptoms, although they do not eliminate the allergy. If you prefer to take a holistic approach, try Nettle tea, a bioflavinoid called quercetin or acupuncture. In recent studies antioxidants such as Vitamins C and E have demonstrated significant anti-allergen effects.

Get tested. An allergy specialist can determine the exact source of your allergic reactions by a simple prick of the skin on your arm or back.

Look at the whole picture. Because allergies rarely come individually wrapped, other culprits, such as dust mites and pollen, may be causing reactions, too. "An individual rarely has a single allergy," says Zuckerman. "A cat owner may be able to tolerate contact with the cat in winter, but when spring arrives, all the allergies together may prove unbearable."

Build up resistance. There is no cure for allergy to cats, but immunotherapy may help increase your tolerance. Immunotherapy involves getting allergy shots once or twice weekly for up to six months, then monthly boosters for three to five years. Some individuals develop complete immunity, while others continue to need shots, and still others find no relief at all.

Coping with an allergy to cats is nothing to sneeze at. It's a commitment. After all, shelters receive cats for this reason every day. Hopefully, following these tips will make a world of difference.
