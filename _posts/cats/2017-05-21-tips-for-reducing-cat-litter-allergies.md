The basic treatment is simple: Don't get too close to the litter material. Keep in mind, though, that Kitty can bring litter to you on her fur, so wash her and your hands often. Changing the type litter can help eliminate your symptoms. Try hypoallergenic litters made of materials such as recycled newspapers or corn kernels. Over-the-counter allergy medications can also help relieve your symptoms. Keep the litter box away from central air intake vents, which can spread the dust throughout the house.

Your vet can prescribe antihistamines to relieve some of Kitty's symptoms, but changing to a hypoallergenic litter might stop the problem. The fragrance in the litter might be the allergen, so try an unscented litter to see if that helps your kitty. Change the litter often, and keep the box as clean as possible by washing it down once or twice a week to reduce allergen buildup. Bathe Kitty at least once a week -- she might actually enjoy it after a while -- and vacuum and wash her bedding regularly to keep discarded litter dust off her fur.

Luckily, litter allergies are easily managed by switching to a hypoallergenic litter, isolating the allergen and taking steps to minimize allergen exposure.

Cat litter can be a major source of allergic reactions from dust residue, dust mites, fragrances or chemicals. Scooping litter, clumping litter and highly scented litter tend to cause allergies from the fine particles. Clumping litter often contains sodium bentonite, which swells when wet and can irritate your lungs if inhaled.

Perhaps you know if you're sensitive to dust or to fragrances. Cat litter is likely not the only problem area for you. If you use a fragrant litter and suspect fragrance sensitivity, switch to an unscented type. So-called pearl litter, pine litter, corn litter or cat litter made from newspaper creates little to no dust. These should not trigger your allergies. If you're not sure whether it's dust or fragrances causing your allergies, test out different litters until you find one that works well.

Dust mites occur throughout the home, not just in cat litter. Try an air purifier with a HEPA filter to reduce dust mites and clean surfaces including rugs and bedding regularly to reduce dust. Place the litter box in a well-ventilated area so odors can escape, but avoid highly trafficked areas (like your bathroom) to reduce exposure to kitty litter. If possible, have someone else change the litter box.

Usually the food trial comes first (it's cheaper and, usually, easier): This involves either getting your kitty to eat an expensive prescription diet or learning to cook for your cat. Problem is, she has to eat just that one food for the entire time of the trial (as long as three months). That means no treats, no sneaks, and no lizards, songbirds, or mice.

So what exactly are allergies anyway? Allergic reactions occur when a human or cat's immune system reacts negatively to any number of substances (which are usually harmless), such as pollen, grass, certain grains, etc. Symptoms like sneezing, wheezing or vomiting happen while the body tries to rid itself of those substances (called "allergens").

The only real way to treat a cat litter allergy is to get rid of the cat litter that's causing the allergic reaction and replace it with another. This may take some time as it's a process of trial and error, but your patience will be rewarded with a kitty that's comfortable and happy to use their cat litter.

Start by getting rid of any clay-based litters. These are extremely dusty and that dust that's getting kicked up contains microscopic particles of silica, something that is especially dangerous and irritating to the lungs. Also be sure to get rid of any cat litter that is scented or has deodorizers in them. These additives contain a lot of chemicals and are not necessary for cat litter. With regular changing, you'll keep toxins out of the air and the litter box will always smell fresh. When you use hypoallergenic cat litters, you can be sure that there are no preservatives, toxins, or additives, so you can be virtually guaranteed that your cat will not suffer an allergic reaction from it.

Your veterinarian may prescribe an antihistamine or cortisone to help alleviate the symptoms that your cat is experiencing. Allergy shots are also available if the litter allergy is severe. Immunotherapy may also be an option for cats that suffer from severe allergies. Once it has been determined that your cat is suffering from litter allergies, your veterinarian may recommend certain litters that do not contain the offending allergens. You may consider switching the type of litter box you are using since ceramic or metal litter boxes will accumulate less dust than the popular plastic litter boxes. Also, avoid dyes, fragrances, and chemically treated litter.

It's all about the type of cat litter you choose. Hanophy advises, "Check ingredients. Also, there are hypoallergenic litters made for cats. "Yesterday's News" is made from paper.  There are also other brands that reduce allergens." Buy cat litter that is fragrance free, scoopable, biodegradable, flushable, and not clay-based. Avoid clay-based litter, pine litter and sawdust-based cat litter. Don't trust the brands that promise to be free of dust - they might be -  but they also contain chemicals that might be cancer causing according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The particles in this litter get into your cat's fur and on her paws and then tracked around the house where humans can become exposed. In addition to the cancer risk there is a much milder risk of respiratory infections. If you have intense asthma, respiratory infections can be particularly dangerous.

The best way to treat your cat's allergies is to remove the allergens from his or her environment. For instance, if your cat's allergies are caused by fleas, using veterinarian-recommended flea and tick preventatives can eliminate the cause. If the problem is cat litter, substituting your normal litter for a dust-free alternative could do the trick. In fact, this might help correct a bigger problem if your cat's been missing his or her litter box.

When it comes to pollen, fungus, mold, or dust, bathing your cat a couple of times per week can help alleviate itching. Your veterinarian can recommend an appropriate shampoo to help you avoid drying out your cat's skin.

A diagnosis of food allergies may require you to provide your cat with a prescription diet or even home-cooked meals free of the offending allergens. Your veterinarian will provide recommendations as to the best course of action. It is possible that your cat will need dietary supplements to ensure he gets all the vital nutrients he needs. 

Medication is sometimes prescribed for cats in case certain allergens cannot be removed from the environment. Medications include:

    Cortisone, steroids or allergy injections for airborne pollens
    Antihistamines as a preventative
    Flea prevention products

There are several preventative measures that can be taken to mitigate your allergy, and Petfinder has helpfully compiled a comprehensive list of the most effective strategies. Here are the top few:

Clear the air!  Invest in a high efficiency particulate arrestance/air (HEPA) filter. Remember that the cat allergen can linger for long periods of time, so continuously straining it out of the air will reduce your exposure to the allergen.
Make your bedroom a cat-free zone. This means wash or, better yet, replace your bedding. Allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers are highly recommended and can be purchased at most home stores.
Limit kitty's domain. Establish designated areas where your cat can travel within your house. Keep your cat away from your workstations by closing doors, for example. Make sure to supply plenty of cozy, warm places in kitty-approved areas.
Decorate wisely. Minimizing upholstered furniture and rugs or carpeting can vastly reduce the amount of allergen buildup in your home. Carpeting, in particular, can accumulate 100 times as many allergens as hardwood floors.
Brush your cat outside!  If you have an open-air enclosure, use this space to brush your cat, so allergen-laden dander can disperse and blow away, rather than accumulating in your home.
