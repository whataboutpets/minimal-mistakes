Before we dive into the list.

Question:

What is a [cat allergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy_to_cats){:target="_blank"}?

![cat with glasses]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/cat-with-glasses.jpg)

Here's the deal:

The job of our immune system is to find foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, and get rid of them.

People with cat allergies have an **over-sensitive immune system**.

It reacts to harmless proteins that are present in a cat's saliva, urine, and dander (dried flakes of skin).

Be warned:

Cat allergy symptoms range from mild to severe.

Seek medical help immediately in case of a [severe reaction](https://www.aafa.org/asthma-symptoms/){:target="_blank"}.

So what's The cure?

[According](https://www.aafa.org/pet-dog-cat-allergies){:target="_blank"} to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) the best treatment is to **avoid contact with cats or the areas where they live**.

Removing kitty from your home is often the best treatment.

Let me guess.

![cat unhappy]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/cat-unhappy.jpg)

No contact or removing is not an option!

So here are some strategies on to how to deal with cat allergies and…

…keep your feline friend.

## 1. Keep out of the Bedroom

![cat on bed sleeping]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/cat-on-bed-sleeping.jpg)

OK, I know what you're thinking.

There's no harm in snuggling with your furry friend.

But consider this:

You spend from one-third to one-half of your time in the bedroom.

That's [minimum eight hours every day](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/excessivesleepiness/content/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need-0){:target="_blank"} that you expose yourself to potential allergens!

So here's the deal:

You need to make your bedroom a cat-free space.

Start by washing bedding, pillows and drapes in hot water…

…and from then on keep the bedroom door closed.

Also, keep cleaning as it may take weeks before you notice results.

The bottom line is this:

Keep kitty out of the bedroom.

## 2. Clean the Air

![dandelion]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/dandelion.jpg)

Allergist Dr. Dana Wallace [states that](https://acaai.org/allergies/types/pet-allergy#section-1){:target="_blank"}:

> Of all the pollen, and mold, and animal dander, dust mites that we have studied, the cat dander is absolutely the smallest dander.

What that means is that allergen remains airborne for at least 30 minutes after you disturb it.

And you know what?

That just allows an allergic patient to have a constant exposure to that allergen.

Now, wouldn't it be great if you could somehow remove allergens from the air?

That's where an air purifier fits in.

These mechanical filters draw in dirty air…

(trap particles in the filter)

…and release clean air.

It sounds simple. And it is.

But remember this:

You need to get an air purifier with a HEPA filter.

These are filters that are capable of [removing particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA){:target="_blank"} the size of animal allergens from the air.

All you have to do is place the purifier in the room where you or your cat spend most of your time.

And run the cleaner continuously.

The result?

This can reduce the concentration of allergens [up to five to seven-fold](https://vet.osu.edu/sites/vet.osu.edu/files/legacy/documents/pdf/education/mph-vph/allergic%20to%20your%20cat.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Nice!

## 3. Vacuum Often

![vacuum cleaner]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/vacuum-cleaner.jpg)

Picture this:

You want to keep the allergen level in your house as low as possible.

So, you vacuum and sweep regularly.

The only problem?

At this point you are not removing the allergens…

…but stirring them so they become airborne.

Making allergies worse!

So, what's the answer?

You want to get a high-efficiency vacuum cleaner.

These are specially designed to prevent outflow of the contents (including pet allergens) that have been swept up.

*TODO

## 4. Time for a Bath

![bathroom]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/bathroom.jpg)

News flash:

Cats have a complex relationship with water.

[According](https://www.petmd.com/cat/behavior/pet-myths-do-cats-really-hate-water){:target="_blank"} to Dr. Katy Nelson they are averse to getting wet.

> Cats do a nice job of bathing themselves—they don't need you to come along and supplement that for them.

But bear with me.

Giving your kitty a bath once a week can help getting rid of your allergies.

Fact:

There are test that [indicate](https://vet.osu.edu/sites/vet.osu.edu/files/legacy/documents/pdf/education/mph-vph/allergic%20to%20your%20cat.pdf){:target="_blank"} that a bath can decrease the concentration of allergen by up to 84 percent.

Sounds good, right?

Just make sure you use a shampoo formulated for cats…

…and stop if your feline friend gets traumatized by the experience.

## 5. No Hugging and Kissing

![kittens]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/kittens.jpg)

Hang onto your seat because:

Your probably not going to like this one…

Fact:

The best treatment for pet allergies is to avoid contact.

And guess what?

The [highest concentration](https://vet.osu.edu/sites/vet.osu.edu/files/legacy/documents/pdf/education/mph-vph/allergic%20to%20your%20cat.pdf){:target="_blank"} of allergens on a cat's body is found on the face and neck.

What this means:

You should try not to hug and kiss your feline friend.

In addition to that, have someone who isn't allergic take care of the washing and brushing.

This might be a difficult one to keep doing.

The choice is yours.

## 6. Wash those Hands

![wash hands]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/wash-hands.jpg)

Good news:

This is one of the simplest tricks on the list.

The first thing you do after you touch or handle kitty:

You wash your hands.

Soap and water will do just fine to remove those allergens.

It's a no-brainer.

## 7. Clean Rigorously and Often

![cleaning products]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/cleaning-products.jpg)

Get this:

Animal allergens are really difficult to get rid of.

Think I'm exaggerating?

Allergist Dr. Warner Carr [states that](https://acaai.org/allergies/types/pet-allergy#section-1){:target="_blank"}:

> Even if you remove a cat from a home, you clean all the walls down, do the laundry, do the draperies, it still takes six months for the level of cat protein to get down to normal.

This means you need mop the floors, vacuum the rugs, and clean furniture regularly.

Don't forget to also regularly wash walls and tiles as allergens also sticks to these surfaces.

The moral of this story?

Lather, rinse, repeat.

## 8. Smooth Floors and Walls If Possible

![wooden floor]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/wooden-floor.jpg)

Want to know a dirty little secret?

Carpets are the primary reservoir of allergens in a home!

To put it another way:

They can contain [13 times](https://vet.osu.edu/sites/vet.osu.edu/files/legacy/documents/pdf/education/mph-vph/allergic%20to%20your%20cat.pdf){:target="_blank"} more cat allergens than smooth floors.

But if you're serious about reducing cat allergies:

Replace carpet for wood, tile or linoleum flooring.

Especially try to get rid of wall-to-wall carpets as it's almost impossible to clean them.

If you must have carpets…

…what can you do about it?

Pick out a type with a low pile.

Beyond that make sure you steam clean them frequently.

Or even better, use washable area rugs and clean them in hot water.

All in all:

Get rid of your carpets!

## 9. Change Your Clothes

![clothes]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/clothes.jpg)

Odds are that this advice has never crossed your mind.

After prolonged exposure to your cat…

…change your clothes.

Why?

Pet allergens are really "sticky".

So they will be all over your clothes.

So how do you remove them?

All you have to do is give them a wash.

In addition to that:

You could wear some old shirt or sweater and then change clothes when done playing with your pet.

You get the idea.

## 10. Keep up with the Laundry

![laundry machines]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/laundry-machines.jpg)

*TODO

Following [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11544455){:target="_blank"} investigated the effectiveness of laundry to remove cat allergens.

For starters:

Make sure you use detergent solutions.

As they remove more allergens than soap or water alone.

Also, the water temperature needs to be above 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

It really is that simple.

## 11. Cover Vents

![vent]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/vent.jpg)

Do you have a [forced-air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced-air){:target="_blank"} system at home that pushes air through ducts?

Then this is important:

You see, these systems can spread allergens throughout the entire house.

Not good!

So what can you do about it?

You start by making sure that bedroom vents are covered with dense filtering material like cheesecloth.

Similarly cover vents in other rooms.

Beyond that you could consider to install a [whole-house air cleaner](https://www.asthmaandallergyfriendly.com/USA/certified-products/whole-home-air-cleaners){:target="_blank"}.

This involves installing an air cleaning device in the ductwork of your home.

Bottom line:

Avoid those allergens from being blow around.

## 12. Brush

![brush]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/brush.jpg)

Question:

Is cat hair an allergen?

Nope.

However, it can collect dander, urine and saliva.

On top of that it can also carry other allergens like dust and pollen.

Do you see where we're going with this?

Basically have someone without a pet allergy regularly brush your furry friend.

And remember:

Make sure to do this outside!

Above all avoid grooming your pet if you have animal allergies.

If you must groom them…

…be sure to wear a disposable dust mask.

## 13. Keep Outside

![cat outside]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/cat-outside.jpg)

## 14. Allergy Shots

![syringe]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/syringe.jpg)

*What if I told you that TODO.

Sounds crazy right…

But just keep reading and I'll explain.

Allergy immunotherapy works by exposing the body to minute amounts of an allergen.

The point?

It helps the body build up an immunity or tolerance to the allergen.

Get this:

There are two common types of immunotherapy:

1. Allergy shots
2. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)

Allergy shots involve giving injections of allergens in an increasing dose over time.

In the case of SLIT, patients are given small doses of an allergen under the tongue.

Bottom line:

You progressively become less sensitive to the allergen.

A word of caution:

Treatment must always be under observation from a medical professional.

*TODO sever reaction

Allergy shots have a proven track record as an effective form of long-term treatment.

Some people will develop complete immunity to cat allergies.

On the other hand, sometimes there is no relief at all.

Will it work for you?

*Talk to your allergist about your options for immunotherapy.
