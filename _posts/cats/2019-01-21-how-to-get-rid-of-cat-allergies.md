Question:

What is a [cat allergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy_to_cats){:target="_blank"}?

Here's the deal:

The job of our immune system is to find foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, and get rid of them.

People with cat allergies have an **over-sensitive immune system**.

It reacts to harmless proteins that are present in a cat's saliva, urine, and dander (dried flakes of skin).

Be warned:

*In some cases TODO

So what's The cure?

According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) the best treatment is to [avoid contact with cats or the areas where they live](https://www.aafa.org/pet-dog-cat-allergies){:target="_blank"}.

Removing kitty from your home is often the best treatment.

Let me guess.

![cat unhappy]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/cat-unhappy.jpg)

No contact or removing is not an option!

So here are some strategies on to how to deal with cat allergies and…

…keep your feline friend.

## 1. Keep out of the Bedroom

![cat on bed sleeping]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/cat-on-bed-sleeping.jpg)

OK, I know what you're thinking.

There's no harm in snuggling with your feline friend.

But consider this:

You spend from one-third to one-half of your time in the bedroom.

That's [minimum eight hours every day](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/excessivesleepiness/content/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need-0){:target="_blank"} that you expose yourself to potential allergens!

So here's the deal:

You need to make your bedroom a cat-free space.

Start by washing bedding, pillows and drapes in hot water…

…and from then on keep the bedroom door closed.

Also, keep cleaning as it may take weeks before you notice results.

The bottom line is this:

Keep kitty out of the bedroom.

## 2. Clean the Air

![dandelion]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/dandelion.jpg)

Allergist Dr. Dana Wallace [states that](https://acaai.org/allergies/types/pet-allergy#section-1){:target="_blank"}:

> Of all the pollen, and mold, and animal dander, dust mites that we have studied, the cat dander is absolutely the smallest dander.

What that means is that allergen remains airborne for at least 30 minutes after you disturb it.

And you know what?

That just allows an allergic patient to have a constant exposure to that allergen.

Now, wouldn't it be great if you could somehow remove these allergens from the air?

That's where an air purifier fits in.

These mechanical filters draw in dirty air…

(trap particles in the filter)

…and release clean air.

It sounds simple. And it is.

But remember this:

You need to get an air purifier with a HEPA filter.

These are filters that are capable of [removing particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA){:target="_blank"} the size of animal allergens from the air.

All you have to do is place the purifier in the room where you or your cat spend most of your time.

And run the cleaner continuously.

The result?

This will reduce the concentration of allergens [up to five to seven-fold](https://vet.osu.edu/sites/vet.osu.edu/files/legacy/documents/pdf/education/mph-vph/allergic%20to%20your%20cat.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Nice!

## 3. Vacuum Often

![vacuum cleaner]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/vacuum-cleaner.jpg)

Picture this:

You want to keep the allergen level in your house as low as possible.

So, you vacuum and sweep regularly.

The only problem?

At this point you are not removing the allergens…

…but stirring them so they become airborne.

Making allergies worse!

So, what's the answer?

You want to get a high-efficiency vacuum cleaner.

These are specially designed to prevent outflow of the contents (including pet allergens) that have been swept up.

## 4. Time for a Bath

![bathroom]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/bathroom.jpg)

News flash:

*Cats and water aren't known to be best friends

But bear with me.

Giving your kitty a bath once a week can help getting rid of your allergies.

Fact:

There are test that [indicate](https://vet.osu.edu/sites/vet.osu.edu/files/legacy/documents/pdf/education/mph-vph/allergic%20to%20your%20cat.pdf){:target="_blank"} that a bath can decrease the concentration of allergen by up to 84 percent.

Sounds good, right?

Just make sure you use a shampoo formulated for cats…

…and stop if your feline friend gets traumatized by the experience.

## 5. No Hugging and Kissing

![kittens]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/kittens.jpg)

Hang onto your seat because:

Your probably not going to like this one…

Fact:

The best treatment for pet allergies is to avoid contact.

And guess what?

The [highest concentration](https://vet.osu.edu/sites/vet.osu.edu/files/legacy/documents/pdf/education/mph-vph/allergic%20to%20your%20cat.pdf){:target="_blank"} of allergens on a cat's body is found on the face and neck.

What this means:

You should try not to hug and kiss your feline friend.

In addition to that, have someone who isn't allergic take care of the washing and brushing.

This might be a difficult one to keep doing.

The choice is yours.

## 6. Wash those Hands

![wash hands]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/wash-hands.jpg)

Good news:

This is one of the simplest tricks on the list.

The first thing you do after you touch or handle kitty:

You wash your hands.

Soap and water will do just fine to remove those allergens.

It's a no-brainer.

## 7. Clean Rigorously and Often

![cleaning products]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/cleaning-products.jpg)

Get this:

Animal allergens are sticky.

This means that they are difficult to get rid of.

Think I'm exaggerating?

Allergist Dr. Warner Carr [states that](https://acaai.org/allergies/types/pet-allergy#section-1){:target="_blank"}:

> Even if you remove a cat from a home, you clean all the walls down, do the laundry, do the draperies, it still takes six months for the level of cat protein to get down to normal.

This means you need mop the floors, vacuum the rugs, and clean furniture regularly.

Don't forget to also regularly wash walls and tiles as allergens also sticks to these surfaces.

The moral of this story?

Lather, rinse, repeat.

## 8. Bare Floors and Walls If Possible

Want to know a dirty little secret?

Carpets are the primary reservoir of allergens in the home!

## 9. Change Your Clothes

![clothes]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/clothes.jpg)

Odds are that this advice has never crossed your mind.

After prolonged exposure to your cat…

…simply change your clothes.

And to remove all allergens:

Give them a wash.

Or even better.

You could wear some old shirt or sweater and then change clothes when done playing with your pet.

You get the idea.

## 10. Keep up with the Laundry

![laundry machines]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/cats/laundry-machines.jpg)

Just make sure the water is at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit.
