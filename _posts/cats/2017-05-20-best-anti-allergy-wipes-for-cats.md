If you or your cat is suffering from allergies, there are a number of things you can do to help keep allergic reactions under control and minimize discomfort. One of them is to reduce the potential [allergens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen) on your feline's fur to a minimum by wiping it down regularly.

There are special pet wipes on the market which are a convenient solution that help to remove dander, dust, cat litter and other dirt in no time. They are an easy, quick way to keep your pet clean and allergen free.

# What Are Hypoallergenic Cat Wipes?

[Hypoallergenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoallergenic) cat wipes are pre-moistened wipes that offer an easy alternative to a daily bath. They can clean, condition, and deodorize your cat's skin and coat with very little effort. In contrast to regular pet wipes, **hypoallergenic wipes typically contain fewer allergens** and as such are less likely to cause allergic reactions.

This product helps to easily wipe away dander, dirt and other potential allergens in your furred friend's coat.

The wipes do not contain added fragrances as a result they are basically odorless. In addition they do not contain parabens, phosphates or pthalates. They are safe for daily use and any residue left behind is completely safe and will not harm your cat.

The size of the wipes can be considered "normal" and they are not overly wet (more on the dry side). They contain a mild cleansers that freshens and deodorizes, in addition to Aloe Vera and Vitamin E to moisturize coat and skin. The product is nice to use for general kitty coat cleaning and will brighten and soften the coat.

The product is alcohol free, safe for all cats and kittens over 6 weeks old. It also does not remove spot-on flea control treatments.

One downside of the product is the packaging. The top latch/button of the box is reported to not always stay closed. As a result some wipes may dry out before you finish the container. A small tip here is to keep the entire box in a zip lock bag.
