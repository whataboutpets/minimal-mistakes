If you or your cat is suffering from allergies, there are a number of things you can do to help keep allergic reactions under control and minimize discomfort. One of them is to reduce the potential [allergens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen) on your feline's fur to a minimum by wiping it down regularly.

There are special pet wipes on the market which are a convenient solution that help to remove dander, dust, cat litter and other dirt in no time. They are an easy, quick way to keep your pet clean and allergen free.

# What Are Hypoallergenic Cat Wipes?

[Hypoallergenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoallergenic) cat wipes are pre-moistened wipes that offer an easy alternative to a daily bath. They can clean, condition, and deodorize your cat's skin and coat with very little effort. In contrast to regular pet wipes, hypoallergenic wipes typically contain fewer allergens and as such are less likely to cause allergic reactions.

Pets can get dirty in no time, but getting your dog or cat ready for a bath can be a nightmare. Instead, opt for pet wipes,  They offer a refresh between baths and are an easy, quick way to keep your pet looking clean and smelling fresh.

Can these wipes be used to wipe the corners of my cats eyes since they are fragrance free? I have used these on my cat's face and she didn't have a bad reaction:)

What are the ingredients?

My cat is older and I haven't seen her groom herself in a long time. I comb and brush her but I am told she smells. I got her these after reading reviews. She loves them. She lies still and purrs while i pet her with one in my hands. Her hair is soft afterward and apparently she smells better. (I have a weak sense of smell so I have to depend on reports from family) 

The packaging is poor. It arrived with a defective lid. It doesn't stay closed. they would all dry out if I didn't improvise closing the top. I am not sure I would buy again unless they change their packaging. I hate to waste them because they dry out before I finish using all the wipes in the container. 

In addition to some allergy relief, I also find that these are nice to use for general kitty coat cleaning. My 2 year old lynx point Siamese has a very soft coat, but it's a little flat on her back and she seems to skip a strip that gets a bit oily. I will occasionally wipe her down with these just to clean up that spot. They are not overly wet so it does not bother her and it seems she kind of likes them because if she sees the box she comes running (ok, she's a bit of a weirdo!).

The only downside is that, as other reviewers say, the box is a little flimsy, particularly the top latch/button, and does not stay closed well. With the suggestions of other reviewers, I simply keep the entire box in a zip lock bag. I have had them for several months and have had no issues with drying out.

Overall, I would definitely recommend these as they seem to be effective for multiple purposes and are an affordable price. Again, the only downside is the packaging which could potentially ruin the product if it is not closing correctly, so I removed a star for that reason.

Does the job. Even though there's no added fragrance to these my cat is not too happy about the smell of this product. She lets me wipe her but when I'm done she licks the scent off her fur. I guess that's normal cat behaviour..
I initially bought these for my pregnant cat who was having a hard time going to the bathroom and to help her clean up after giving birth, for this they are not great. The wipes are not moist enough to get gunk out of cat fur that has been sitting there for more than 5 minutes.

UPDATE: It's unnecessarily hard to get to the wipes once you've used about half of them. You have to completely remove the lid to get to them (my fingers won't reach the wipes from the tiny slot under the little opening you press open with the button on top). Again, the wipes are very dry, and after my last visit to the vet, I noticed they use regular baby wipes, which are less expensive than these so I don't see why I would ever buy wipes especially made for cats again.

The last 'cat wipes' that we bought were giant... you could use them as a blanket to cover the cat after you were done giving it a bath. These are a 'normal' size, so you don't feel like you are wasting them. The others we had were lavender scent, but these are basically odorless (which I think the cats prefer).

## Burts Bees Dander Reducing Cat Wipes

https://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Dander-Reducing-Wipes/dp/B01CCV8GUA/ref=sr_1_3?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1495276907&sr=1-3&keywords=cat+wipes+for+allergies

 How many wipes are in the container? 50 per the packaging.

 These wipes are very moist but not dripping wet. I go through about 4 on her in a sitting. It is ideal if she gets a good brushing first but that is subject to mood in the moment. These wipes have lessened the dandruff and greatly approved the appearance of her coat. They are not as good as a dunk in the tub but the old girl would likely kill me or keel over if I put her in water. I am grateful to have found these and will continue to use them as long as she decides to grace us with her presence.

There's no artificial fragrance and it's all natural and safe for your little furry babies. They are also made by a reputable company unlike others I've seen. I'm happy I found these so my little guy feels more comfortable and happy.

I've ordered these twice now for my older cat who doesn't clean herself quite as good as she used to and now she makes me sneeze! I've tried other wipes and they did nothing, but these really work. Any my picky cat actually doesn't mind them--and that's saying a lot!! Order them--you won't be sorry!

This stuff changed the game for my elderly cat! He has some difficulty grooming these days, so I ordered these wipes figuring it couldn't hurt to try them, even if the glowing claims were exaggerated. But let me just say, these babies work like a charm. Dandruff - gone! Soft, kitteny fur in its place. I'm impressed. And my allergies have subsided significantly.


My husband is allergic to cats but has put up with our cat the last few years fairly well. When we got our new kitten his allergies seemed to get worse and so we bought these on the recommendation of the rescue that we got our new kitty from. They really seem to have cut down on my husband's allergies and I use them on both cats in between bats.

I have two black cats and with one of them, it was visibly obvious she a quite a bit on dandruff going on (she is otherwise a very healthy cat.) I ordered these wipes because brushing her every day was not enough to help her with her dandruff. Since using these wipes every day after a good brushing, her dandruff is improving greatly. Although she does not like the wipes (she hates being wet) they are wet enough to make an impact on her coat, and they do NOT have an overpowering scent (which I love!) I highly recommend this product to anyone who might have a similar problem.

Works really well. I found that brushing them right after helps with their enjoyment of the wipes. 

I have two cats, a three year old tortie with asthma and a 15 year old maine coon with eczema. i have extremely sensitive skin and suffer from allergies and asthma as well, so im a long time fan of burts bees products. i originally bought these for my asthmatic cat, as she tends to sneeze a lot while grooming herself. they worked really well to reduce her asthma attacks. i tried them on my senior cat and he absolutely loves them too!! i can tell they comfort his dry skin. he'll sit in my lap and purr while i wipe him down. :)

I find that these wipes can work. However, what seems to work just as well is taking a moist paper towel and rubbing it down the back of the cat.

It is the act of removing dander that seems to help.

These cleansing wipes make it easy to remove dander and dried saliva from your cat's coat, keeping loose hair, dander and the Fel d1 allergen out of the air you breathe. Wipes contain gentle cleansing and antiseptic agents that also soften and moisturize your cat's skin. Use twice the first week, then once every two weeks for cats that stay indoors. For cats that also spend time outside you may need to use more often. Each package of Quick Bath Cleansing Wipes for Cats contains 10 wipes in a sealable pack. Each wipe is 5" x 10" and alcohol free.
