Think you're allergic to your cat? You might be allergic to the cat litter instead. Kitty litter comes in a variety of materials and may even contain additional additives or chemicals. As human allergies are triggered by substances in our surrounding environment, **the cat litter you are using could be the cause of the allergic reaction you are experiencing**.

# What Are Human Allergies?

So what exactly are human allergies anyway? [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy), allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by **hypersensitivity of the human immune system to something in our surroundings** that usually causes little problems with most people.

In other words, a substance called "**allergen**" will produce an abnormally vigorous immune response in which our immune system fights off a perceived threat that would otherwise be harmless to the body. As we will see further down, cat litter can contain certain allergens.

Allergies can develop with **any person at any age**. So even if you have been using a certain type of cat litter for a long time without it causing an allergic reaction, nothing is to say that at a certain moment, you could become allergic to it.

In addition, there is believed to be a strong **genetic correlation** in contracting allergies. In other words, if your parents have cat litter allergies, then you are likely to have them also.

What is also interesting to know is that, like people, [cats can also develop allergies to cat litter]({{ site.url }}/2016/01/can-cats-be-allergic-to-cat-litter.html). The causes, symptoms and treatment are actually very similar to each other.

A lot of cat litters are made of **clay** and are known to produce fair amounts of dust. As it so happens, dust is a known airborne allergen that can cause an allergic reaction when it comes in contact with your eyes, nose or lungs.

Some litters have **perfumes** or other additives that are added in order to help control odor. These fragrances are also a potential allergen that might trigger the allergies you are experiencing.

In addition to the above, additional minerals or chemicals can be found in certain cat litters that could trigger allergies and in some cases even more serieus reperatory problems.

**Silicon dioxide**, also known as silica, is one such example. It is a chemical compound that can be found in clay and a number of other minerals. Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust can lead to silicosis, bronchitis, or cancer, as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates them.
