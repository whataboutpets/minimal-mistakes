You might be surprised to hear that **rabbits can be easily trained to use a litter box**. Actually, bunnies are pretty clean animals by nature. As such they make for wonderful indoor companions.

Basically, bunnies have their own preferred corners for eliminating, it is up to you to find them and put the litter tray there.

We have compiled a number of tips in order to help you get up to speed with litter training your rabbit:

# 1) Baby vs Older Rabbit

You can start to litter train a rabbit at any age.

Contrary to what you might think it is actually **easier to litter train older rabbits**. The reason for this is that a rabbit's attention span and ability to learn increases as they grow up. This also means that if you have a baby rabbit you will probably need to put in a little bit more effort.

# 2) Spaying/Neutering Makes a Difference

This might sound like a bit of unusual advice but **rabbits that are neutered or spayed are easier to litter train**.

The reason for this is that when bunnies reach the age of 4-6 months, they will generally begin marking their territory as hormones start to become active.

> If you see that your pet rabbit all of a sudden starts pooping/spraying everywhere it can be linked to territorial behavior. Spaying/neutering can help in order reduce these feelings and increase the likelihood of using the litter box.

# 3) Start Small

Even if you intend to let your bunny roam through the house, **you need to start small**. The reason for this is that being confined to a small area will help a rabbit to find the litter box. 

> The **biggest mistake** people make when litter training is giving the rabbit **too much freedom, too soon**.

Ideally, you start off in a room that has a **floor that is easy to clean**. In other words an area with tiles or linoleum like for example a bathroom or a utility room.

Begin by keeping your rabbit in a generous cage or hutch. You can even use a pen to offer a bit of running space.

Place a litter box in a corner of the cage. If you have a running space also add one or more boxes. Keep an eye one where your rabbit urinates and if it is in a place that does not contain a box, move an existing box to that location. You can also gently herd your rabbit back to a litter tray if you see the tail being lifted in a corner where there is no box.

> A **small amount of hay in the litter box** can help to attract your bunny and spend time there. Most rabbits like eating on their tray and some even sleep there.

# 4) Sticking To A Few Preferred Spots

Typically most rabbits will choose a **limited number of preferred spots** for eliminating. So you basically you need to find where your rabbit enjoys to deposit their urine and most of its poops and put a litter box there.

> Usually bunnies will pick corners so these are good starting locations for placing the litter boxes.

Don't be surprised if your pet rabbit needs to have a couple of litter boxes. Reason for this is that rabbits may eat in one and pee in another. Some will even sleep in their litter tray.

# 5) Cages And Pens

A cage is a good way to limit the amount of free space your bunny has when you start litter training. Just **make sure the cage is big enough** to contain your rabbit's food, water, and litter box while still allowing for space to move around and stretch.

If your cage is rather small you can provide a bit of extra running space by using a pen. Make sure to also foresee a litter tray in the pen area.

Corners of the cage or pen are a good place to start when choosing a litter tray location.

# 6) Choosing The Litter Box And Get More Than One

When starting the training it is best to **provide a couple of litter boxes**. This will help your long-eared friend in finding its preferred location(s) for eliminating.

As rabbits are diggers, they can kick their litter out of the box. In addition, they might back up in the corner so far that they urinate over the edge. Getting a box with higher edges or a cover can help to control these problems.

# 7) Choosing The Litter Type

There are a number of options available when choosing the type of litter you will use. A lot will actually depend on your bunny's habbits.

Typically rabbits like to spend a lot of time in their litter boxes and they will even nible on some of the litter. This means that you should **avoid litter types that can be harmfull** when inhaled or ingested. Examples are litters made from TODO. Also stay away from cat litters as they might cause health issues.

Our advise is to opt for organic litters, made from hay or paper.

Make sure to **change the litter frequentlty**. If you are using hay then aim to change on a daily basis. This will encourage hay consumption in addition to training litter habbits as bunnies often like to eat around the same time they use the litter box.

> When using hay make sure that your rabbit needs to hop into the litter box in order to reach the hay.
