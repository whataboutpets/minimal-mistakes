[Strawberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry){:target="_blank"} are cultivated worldwide and are known for their bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. They are a popular fruit and not just among us humans. The low-lying strawberry plants are actually easy for wild rabbits to reach, something fruit and vegetable garden owners might know only too well.

Strawberries have a sweet taste because they are rich in sugar. This means they **are to be considered as a treat** for your fluffy friend. Too many strawberries may lead to stomach troubles.

As with all fruit, portion control is key in order to ensure a healthy diet. As a general rule of thumb, don't offer more than **a strawberry per day per rabbit** and alternate with other fruits. If it's the first time offering the treat to your bunny, then introduce slowly.

# Can Rabbits Eat Strawberry Tops or Leaves?

If you're wondering whether your rabbit can also eat the strawberry tops or even the strawberry leaves then the answer is yes. **They can actually eat any part of the plant**, just make sure to clean with streaming water before feeding.
