[Kale](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/kale){:target="_blank"} is a member of the cabbage family. It's center leaves do not form a head as is the case with headed cabbages. Kale plants can have green or purple leaves and come in two varieties: **kale** (which has smooth leaves), and **curly kale** (which has crinkly leaves).

# Do Rabbits Eat Kale?

From a nutrition point of view, kale is composed out of 84% water. It is a **rich source of vitamin A** and also contains a good amount of **calcium**.

There are a number of sources which advice not to feed kale to rabbits because of it's high level of oxalates. [Oxalate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalate#Occurrence_in_nature){:target="_blank"} occurs in many plants, where it is a waste product of the incomplete oxidation of carbohydrates. If a rabbit consumes large amounts of oxalates then this **could contribute to bladder sludge or other health issues**.

It looks however that above information is contradicted by one of the most reliable sources on rabbit feeding that actually [mentions](http://rabbit.org/suggested-vegetables-and-fruits-for-a-rabbit-diet/){:target="_blank"} kale as a **leafy green low on oxalates**. In addition, there is a database of [foods analyzed for oxalate content](https://regepi.bwh.harvard.edu/health/Oxalate/files){:target="_blank"} maintained by the Harvard School of Public Health which classifies kale as very low on oxalates.

Based on the above we see no reason to exclude kale from a rabbit's diet. So if you are looking for a new leafy green or if you have already been feeding kale then there is no reason to be worried. Just make sure to **rotate with other greens on a regular basis** and pay attention to how your bun behaves.
