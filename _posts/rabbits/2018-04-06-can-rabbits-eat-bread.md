# Do Rabbits Eat Bread?

Bread contains plenty of carbohydrates, but other than that it offers **little nutritional value** for rabbits. In fact, a rabbit's digestive system is uniquely designed to consume large amounts of plant material. Feeding other types of food like for example bread can throw the whole digestive system out of balance. As a result, your bunny will probably have a **hard time digesting**.

In addition, when offering a rabbit a lot of bread, it can become overweight and inactive, which could lead to other health problems.

Technically, yes, rabbits can eat bread and a quick Internet search reveals a number of [accounts](http://forums.rabbitrehome.org.uk/showthread.php?172734-Is-brown-bread-really-bad-for-rabbits){:target="_blank"} where rabbit owners mention they (occasionally) feed their bunny a bit of bread. And although in most cases this will do no harm we suggest you **opt for the healthier treats like fruits**.

**Conclusion:** rabbits can eat bread but they shouldn't.
