[Grapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape){:target="_blank"} are grown all over the world and aside from being used for wine production, they are a popular between-meal snack for us humans. They are actually a kind of berry and come in many colors, including green, red, black, yellow, pink, and purple.

# Do Rabbits Eat Grapes?

Grapes taste sweet as they are **packed with natural sugar**. And because of this, most bunnies will love to eat them. However, as with other fruit, it is important to consider grapes as **occasional treats** that complete a healthy rabbit diet.

Before offering the grapes, **rinse them thoroughly with running water** as many grape vineyards will rely on pesticides to keep their grapes safe from bugs. Then simply remove the grapes from the cluster and feed them as a whole.

If you haven't offered your rabbit grapes so far then it might be a good idea to cut it up in half. This way it is easier for them to smell and taste the juice.

Feeding too many grapes at a time could cause digestive problems with your rabbit. And in the long run, all that sugar will probably cause other problems like obesity. In other words, make sure to **offer grapes in small amounts**. As a simple rule of thumb feed **one grape per rabbit per day**.

> Grapes are also easy to hand-feed your bunny and allow you to develop a close bond with your pet.
