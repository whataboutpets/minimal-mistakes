Looking for healthy treats for your pet rabbit? Or are you not sure whether your bunny can eat a certain type of food like apples, celery, grapes, tomatoes or even carrots. In order to help you make a choice, we have created a list of food items and whether it is a good idea to feed them to rabbits or not.

*Disclaimer*{:.underline}: the list below is by no means exhaustive. **If you're unsure** about feeding a rabbit a certain type of food, our best advice is to **just don't do it**. While doing our research, we have tried to come up with a list with lots of alternatives. If you know of other food items that your rabbit really enjoys let us know in the comments section below.

## What Does a Rabbit Eat?

Before going over the different food items, there are some basic rabbit feeding aspects we need to cover. In general, the best foods for rabbits are those that provide the nutrients, minerals and vitamins a bunny needs for healthy growth and development. Most of these foods are actually similar to what [wild rabbits will consume on their own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit#Diet_and_eating_habits) (grass, forbs, and leafy weeds).

The most important item in a rabbit's diet is **fresh hay** (dried grass) and it should be available in **constant and abundant quantities**. Hay will provide your rabbit with the essential fiber to maintain a healthy gut movement. It also helps wearing down a rabbit's teeth which continuously grow.

**Fresh vegetables** are also key as they provide additional nutrients to the diet. The bulk of these vegetables should be **leafy greens** which help keep intestinal contents hydrated, making them easier to pass. On top of that, they will provide different tastes and textures for your long eared friend to enjoy. Offer around 2 cups of chopped vegetables per 6 lbs (=3 kg) of body weight per day and include around 3 to 6 types of vegetables.

As a general rule of thumb, any leafy green that is safe for a human or a horse to eat is safe for a rabbit to consume. But there are some exceptions as we will see further down below.

**Rabbit pellets** provide a concentrated source of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that a rabbit might not get if only fed hay and vegetables. However, only a **small amount** of pellets is needed to assure a healthy rabbit. Make sure to use good quality pellets and avoid muesli-style mixes.

**Fruits** are to be **considered as treats** and should be **offered in very limited quantities**. As a general rule no more than 1 tablespoon per 2 lbs (=1 kg) of body weight per day. While fruit is a source of minerals and vitamins, it also contains a lot of natural sugars. Feeding your bunny too much fruit might lead to intestinal problems in the short term, as well as abnormal weight gain or other health problems in the long term.

Last but not least we want to stress the importance of providing your rabbit access to **fresh drinking water** all day round. If a rabbit is deprived of water, ingested food becomes dry and difficult to push through. This, in turn, can lead to a condition known as [ileus](), which can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated.

So what can rabbits eat? Let's dive into the list!

## Can Rabbits Eat Apples? - In Small Amounts

![image-left](/assets/images/icons/food/apple.png){: .align-left}

Rabbits have a taste for sweet food and will really like to eat fresh fruit as occasional treats. Apples can be considered as a **safe and harmless fruit choice** for rabbits.

They are however [high in calories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#Nutrition) as they contain lots of sugar, so make sure to **keep the quantity of this treat to a minimum**. Note that if your rabbit already has a weight problem, it is best to avoid feeding any type of fruit, including apples.

If it is the first time you offer an apple to your rabbit, it is best to introduce the new food slowly in order to allow the digestive system to adjust. Leave a couple of days between offering another apple and keep a watch on the stools. If you see the droppings get soft, stop the introduction and try again after some time.

Before feeding the apple, make sure to **rinse it with clear running water** in order to [remove contaminations](http://fyi.uwex.edu/safepreserving/2013/10/07/safe-healthy-does-washing-produce-remove-pesticides/). A good way to serve the apple to your rabbit is by cutting it up into smaller pieces. As mentioned keep the portions small. For instance, a teaspoon or two per rabbit per day.

If you are wondering whether rabbits can also eat the skin of the apple then the answer is yes. The **apple skin** actually [packs most of the fibers and vitamins](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/19/never-peel-apple_n_4791328.html) that an apple contains. So next time you are making an apple pie, don't throw away those skins but keep them as a treat.

When offering apples, **make sure to remove the seeds**. The reason for this is that apple seeds contain [amygdalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#Toxicity_of_seeds), a sugar and cyanide compound. This toxic substance is only present in very small quantities and as such there is no reason to panic in case your rabbit has accidentally swallowed some seeds. The greater concern would be continuous consumption where the amygdalin was progressively building up in your rabbit's system to the point of reaching toxic levels.

So yes rabbits can eat apples, but not the seeds!

## Can Rabbits Eat Celery? - In Moderation

Celery is a kind of vegetable that [mainly consists of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery#Nutrition). It is low in calories and is a good source of fiber, vitamin C, potassium, sodium, and calcium.

Celery is definitely a vegetable we recommend offering to your rabbit. Make sure to introduce it in small quantities and don't be tempted to give it in large amounts in the beginning. For example start with one small piece and keep an eye on how your bunny reacts to it.

Before feeding the celery, **cut away any damaged or bruised areas**. Then rinse by holding under running water and rubbing gently. Once finished, you don't even need to dry the celery and can actually **serve it wet** as this will help increase your bunny's intake of water.

**Cut the celery stalks** into 1 inch (=2.5cm) pieces. This will avoid strings getting stuck between your rabbit's teeth. In addition, it will help to make the quantities better controllable as you can actually count the pieces your rabbit gets.

Most people know celery from grocery stores where most part of the leaves have been chopped off. A nice little tip is to **try and find a place that sells the celery as a whole**. Your bunny will love the lush dark green celery leaves!

As far as portion size is concerned, typically **one stick of celery per bunny** is recommended. Also, make sure to combine with other vegetables as an adult rabbit should be offered around 3 to 6 different types of vegetables per day.

In conclusion, rabbits can have celery and from what we read, many bunnies seem to like it quite a bit.

## Can Rabbits Eat Grapes? - In Small Amounts

Grapes are grown all over the world and aside from being used for wine production they are a popular between-meal snack for us humans. They are actually [a kind of berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape) and come in many colors, including green, red, black, yellow, pink, and purple.

Grapes taste sweet as they are **packed with natural sugar**. And because of this, most bunnies will love to eat them. However as with other fruit, it is important to consider grapes as **occasional treats** that complete a healthy rabbit diet.

Before offering the grapes, **rinse them thoroughly with running water** as many grape vineyards will rely on pesticides to keep their grapes safe from bugs. Then simply remove the grapes from the cluster and feed them as a whole.

If it's the first time you are giving a grape to your rabbit then it might be a good idea to cut it up in half. This way it is easier for them to smell and taste the juice.

Feeding to many grapes at a time could cause digestive problems with your rabbit. And in the long run, all that sugar will probably cause other problems like obesity. In other words, make sure to **offer grapes in small amounts**. As a simple rule of thumb feed **one grape per rabbit per day**.

So sure, rabbits can eat grapes as an occasional treat. They are also easy to hand-feed your bunny and allow you to develop a close bond with your pet.

## Can Rabbits Eat Tomatoes? - In Small Amounts

Tomatoes are the edible fruit of the tomato plant which originates from Central and South America. Even though from a culinary point of view tomatoes are considered to be vegetables, [they are actually a fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato).

Tomatoes mostly consist of water, but they also contain **sugars** and dietary fiber. Like other fruits, they **should be considered as a treat** for you rabbit. This means that they should be offered in limited quantities as feeding too much will lead to digestive troubles.

Make sure to rinse and discard any rotten fruits before presenting to your bunny. There is no need to peel the tomato as rabbits can also eat the skin and the seeds without a problem. We recommend feeding a rabbit **no more than a few slices of tomato per day**.

Although rabbits can eat tomatoes, **they should not be fed stems, vines, leaves, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant**. The reason for this is that the tomato plant is part of the [nightshade family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae). Many members of this plant family contain potent alkaloids, and some are highly **toxic**.

However, we are not able to conclude that by default the tomato plant is toxic for all rabbits. It really seems to depend on the tomato plant and on the rabbit. We even came across [accounts](http://rabbittalk.com/should-rabbits-eat-tomato-greens-t4411.html#p43266) where people state they have fed tomato plants to their rabbits without any problems. **Our advice is to not take the risk and only feed the actual fruit**.

To sum up, yes rabbits can eat tomatoes, but only the ripe ones and in small amounts.

## Can Rabbits Eat Strawberries? - In Small Amounts

Strawberries are cultivated worldwide and are known for their [bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry). They are a popular fruit and not just among us humans. The low-lying strawberry plants are actually easy for wild rabbits to reach, something fruit and vegetable garden owners might know only too well.

In addition to **sugar** and some dietary fibers, strawberries are an excellent source of vitamin C. The fact that they are rich in sugar also means they **are to be considered as a treat** for your fluffy friend. Too many strawberries may lead to stomach troubles.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaBWS-M39hM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you're wondering whether your rabbit can also eat the **strawberry tops** or even the **strawberry leaves** then the answer is yes. **They can actually eat any part of the plant**, just make sure to clean with streaming water before feeding.

As with all fruit, portion control is key in other to ensure a healthy diet. As a general rule of thumb, don't offer more than **a strawberry per day per rabbit** and alternate with other fruits. If it's the first time offering the treat to your bunny, then introduce slowly.

Bottom line, strawberries are a great occasional treat for your rabbit.

## Can Rabbits Eat Watermelon? - In Small Amounts

Watermelons originally come from Africa and are actually a special kind of berry called [pepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_%28botany%29#Modified_berries). They are known for their smooth rind, which is the tough outer skin, usually green with dark green stripes.

A watermelon is more than 91 percent water. In addition to **sugar**, it also contains vitamin C in moderate quantity. Because of the sugar, watermelon **should be seen as a treat**.

Aside from the interior flesh, the **watermelon rind is also safe** for bunnies to eat. When it comes to the watermelon seeds, we haven't come across any reference saying that they are poisonous for rabbits. Just to be on the safe side we advise that you **remove the seeds** before feeding.

Limit portions to about **one inch (= 2.5cm) cubes per rabbit per day**. As watermelon juice is quite sticky, offer pieces they can easily eat in order to avoid their fur getting dirty. When offering for the first time be sure to start with a small amount to see your bunnies reaction.

Rabbits can have watermelon but don't let them have too much.

## Can Rabbits Eat Bananas? - In Small Amounts

The banana is an edible fruit, that from a botanical point of view, is actually a berry. While the [original wild bananas contain large seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#Modern_cultivation), bananas for human consumption are grown asexually from offshoots and have tiny infertile black specks where the seeds used to be.

Practically every banana consumed in the western world is directly descended from a plant that was grown in the Derbyshire estate's hothouse 180 years ago. They are commonly referred to as [Cavendish group bananas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#Cavendish), named after William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire.

Bananas contain quite **a lot of starch and sugar** in addition to being a good source of vitamin B. Because of their high sugar content they are to be seen as a **treat** that should **only be offered in very small quantities** to your rabbit.

Contrary to what you might think, the peel of a banana is actually edible by both us humans and your rabbit. Our advice is to **only feed the peel of organic bananas** which are not treated with pesticides. This opposite to [industrial banana farming which is typically pesticide-intensive](http://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2014/04/bananas) as bananas are grown in massive monocultures, without crop rotation.

Offer your bunny **no more than 2 to 3 slices of banana per rabbit per day**. It is especially important to keep the quantities small as your long eared friends intestines are designed to digest grass and not food products high in carbohydrates (starch and sugar) like the banana.

Even though your bunny will most likely go banana's over this treat, be careful to only offer it in very limited quantities.

## Can Rabbits Eat Cabbage? - In Small Amounts

Cabbage is a [multi-layered vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage), grown for its dense-leaved head. Within the cabbage family, there are three main cultivar groups: **savoy cabbage, red cabbage, and white cabbage**.

In addition to dietary fiber, cabbage leaves are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin C.

Although they qualify as leafy greens, cabbages should only be fed to your rabbit in limited quantities. The reason for this is that [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2062672/) have shown that **feeding rabbits daily rations of cabbage can cause enlargement of the thyroid**. This is a large ductless gland in the neck which secretes hormones that regulate growth and development.

We also came across some [accounts](http://www.binkybunny.com/FORUM/tabid/54/aft/124444/Default.aspx) that mention cabbage might **cause gas with rabbits**. This assumption is probably based on the fact that [people often get gas from cruciferous vegetables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence#Cause) like cabbage. However, we were not able to find scientific evidence to support this statement in the case of rabbits and it looks like this has more to do with the fact that **some rabbits are more sensitive to certain vegetables** than others.

Based on the above, we advise **to not feed cabbage on a daily basis and to keep portions limited**. If it's the first time, introduce in small amounts and make sure the leaves have been rinsed before offering.

This was a tricky one, rabbits can eat cabbage leaves but only in small amounts.

## Can Rabbits Eat Broccoli - In Small Amounts

Broccoli is an edible green plant in the [cabbage family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli). It has large flower-heads which consist out of tight clusters of buds, usually green in color, with thick and edible stems. When sold, broccoli is often wrapped in cellophane as it deteriorates faster if it is in contact with the air.

Broccoli is an excellent source of vitamin C and K. It also contains moderate amounts of several B vitamins and the [dietary mineral manganese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli#Nutrition). Because the **flower and stalk parts are higher in starch and sugars** we recommend only offering them in **smaller quantities** to your rabbit.

Although the leaves are perfectly edible for us humans, broccoli is typically sold with only the flower and stalk parts of the plant. For bunnies however, **the leaves are actually the best parts** as they are not that high in starch or sugars compared to the flowers and stalks. So a good tip would be to **try and find a place that sells the whole plant** so you can offer your rabbit those nice lush broccoli leaves in moderate amounts.

When doing our research we found a number of [references](http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-5/calcium.html) that mention **higher amounts of calcium in broccoli leaves**. However in most cases this will not be a concern as **calcium is an essential part of your rabbit's diet** in addition to the fact that the amount of calcium in broccoli leaves is still relatively moderate. Our advice is to **consult with your veterinarian** if in doubt about your rabbits calcium intake.

Broccoli belongs to the [genus Brassica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica) which is commonly reputed to increase flatulence with human beings. A rabbit's gastrointestinal tract, however, is not the same as a human's and because of this, we **cannot automatically assume that broccoli is a "gassy" vegetable**.
