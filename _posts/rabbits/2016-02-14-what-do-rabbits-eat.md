## What Does a Rabbit Eat?

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/rabbits/wild-rabbit-eating.jpg" alt="wild rabbit eating" class="align-right">

Before going over the different food items, there are some basic rabbit feeding aspects we need to cover. In general, the best foods for rabbits are those that provide the nutrients, minerals, and vitamins a bunny needs for healthy growth and development. Most of these foods are actually similar to what [wild rabbits will consume on their own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit#Diet_and_eating_habits){:target="_blank"} (grass, forbs, and leafy weeds).

The most important item in a rabbit's diet is **fresh hay** (dried grass) and it should be available in **constant and abundant quantities**. Hay will provide your rabbit with the essential fiber to maintain a healthy gut movement. It also helps wearing down a rabbit's teeth which continuously grow.

**Fresh vegetables** are also key as they provide additional nutrients to the diet. The bulk of these vegetables should be **leafy greens** which help keep intestinal contents hydrated, making them easier to pass. On top of that, they will provide different tastes and textures for your long eared friend to enjoy. Offer around 2 cups of chopped vegetables per 6 lbs (=3 kg) of body weight per day and include around 3 to 6 types of vegetables.

As a general rule of thumb, any leafy green that is safe for a human or a horse to eat is safe for a rabbit to consume. But there are some exceptions as we will see further down below.

**Rabbit pellets** provide a concentrated source of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that a rabbit might not get if only fed hay and vegetables. However, only a **small amount** of pellets is needed to assure a healthy rabbit. Make sure to use good quality pellets and avoid muesli-style mixes.

**Fruits** are to be **considered as treats** and should be **offered in very limited quantities**. As a general rule no more than 1 tablespoon per 2 lbs (=1 kg) of body weight per day. While fruit is a source of minerals and vitamins, it also contains a lot of natural sugars. Feeding your bunny too much fruit might lead to intestinal problems in the short term, as well as abnormal weight gain or other health problems in the long term.

Last but not least we want to stress the importance of providing your rabbit access to **fresh drinking water** all day round. If a rabbit is deprived of water, ingested food becomes dry and difficult to push through. This, in turn, can lead to a condition known as [ileus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileus){:target="_blank"}, which can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated.

_So what can rabbits eat? Let's dive into the list!_

## Can Rabbits Eat Apples? - *In Small Amounts*{:.orange}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/apples.jpg" alt="apples" class="align-right">

Rabbits have a taste for sweet food and will really like to eat fresh fruit as occasional treats. Apples can be considered as a **safe and harmless fruit choice** for rabbits.

Apples originate from Central Asia and their skin is generally red, yellow or green.

They are, however [high in calories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#Nutrition){:target="_blank"} as they contain lots of sugar, so make sure to **keep the quantity of this treat to a minimum**. Note that if your rabbit already has a weight problem, it is best to avoid feeding any type of fruit, including apples.

If it is the first time you offer an apple to your rabbit, it is best to introduce the new food slowly in order to allow the digestive system to adjust. Leave a couple of days between offering another apple and keep a watch on the stools. If you see the droppings get soft, stop the introduction and try again after some time.

Before feeding the apple, make sure to **rinse it with clear running water** in order to [remove contaminations](http://fyi.uwex.edu/safepreserving/2013/10/07/safe-healthy-does-washing-produce-remove-pesticides/){:target="_blank"}. A good way to serve the apple to your rabbit is by cutting it up into smaller pieces. As mentioned keep the portions small. For instance, a couple of slices per rabbit per day.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpIXMkC91rI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you are wondering whether rabbits can also eat the skin of the apple then the answer is yes. The **apple skin** actually [packs most of the fibers and vitamins](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/19/never-peel-apple_n_4791328.html){:target="_blank"} that an apple contains. So next time you are making an apple pie, don't throw away those skins but keep them as a treat.

When offering apples, **make sure to remove the seeds**. The reason for this is that apple seeds contain [amygdalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple#Toxicity_of_seeds){:target="_blank"}, a sugar and cyanide compound. This toxic substance is only present in very small quantities and as such, there is no reason to panic in case your rabbit has accidentally swallowed some seeds. The greater concern would be continuous consumption where the amygdalin was progressively building up in your rabbit's system to the point of reaching toxic levels.

_So yes rabbits can eat apples and their skin, but not the seeds!_

## Can Rabbits Eat Celery? - *In Lesser Amounts*{:.blue}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/celery.jpg" alt="celery" class="align-right">

Celery is a kind of vegetable that [mainly consists of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery#Nutrition){:target="_blank"}. It is low in calories and is a good source of fiber, vitamin C, potassium, sodium, and calcium.

Celery is definitely a vegetable we recommend offering to your rabbit. Make sure to introduce it in small quantities and don't be tempted to give it in large amounts in the beginning. For example, start with one small piece and keep an eye on how your bunny reacts to it.

Before feeding the celery, **cut away any damaged or bruised areas**. Then rinse by holding under running water and rubbing gently. Once finished, you don't even need to dry the celery and can actually **serve it wet** as this will help increase your bunny's intake of water.

**Cut the celery stalks** into 1 inch (=2.5cm) pieces. This will avoid strings getting stuck between your rabbit's teeth. In addition, it will help to make the quantities better controllable as you can actually count the pieces your rabbit gets.

Most people know celery from grocery stores where most part of the leaves have been chopped off. If you are wondering whether your rabbit can also eat the celery leaves then the answer is yes. A nice little tip is to **try and find a place that sells the celery as a whole**. Your bunny will love the lush dark green celery leaves!

As far as portion size is concerned, typically **one stick of celery per bunny** is recommended. Also, make sure to combine with other vegetables as an adult rabbit should be offered around 3 to 6 different types of vegetables per day.

_In conclusion, rabbits can have celery and from what we read, many bunnies seem to like it quite a bit._

## Can Rabbits Eat Grapes? - *In Small Amounts*{:.orange}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/grapes.jpg" alt="grapes" class="align-right">

Grapes are grown all over the world and aside from being used for wine production, they are a popular between-meal snack for us humans. They are actually [a kind of berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape){:target="_blank"} and come in many colors, including green, red, black, yellow, pink, and purple.

Grapes taste sweet as they are **packed with natural sugar**. And because of this, most bunnies will love to eat them. However, as with other fruit, it is important to consider grapes as **occasional treats** that complete a healthy rabbit diet.

Before offering the grapes, **rinse them thoroughly with running water** as many grape vineyards will rely on pesticides to keep their grapes safe from bugs. Then simply remove the grapes from the cluster and feed them as a whole.

If you haven't offered your rabbit grapes so far then it might be a good idea to cut it up in half. This way it is easier for them to smell and taste the juice.

Feeding too many grapes at a time could cause digestive problems with your rabbit. And in the long run, all that sugar will probably cause other problems like obesity. In other words, make sure to **offer grapes in small amounts**. As a simple rule of thumb feed **one grape per rabbit per day**.

_So sure, rabbits can eat grapes as an occasional treat. They are also easy to hand-feed your bunny and allow you to develop a close bond with your pet._

## Can Rabbits Eat Tomatoes? - *In Small Amounts*{:.orange}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/tomatoes.jpg" alt="tomatoes" class="align-right">

Tomatoes are the edible fruit of the tomato plant which originates from Central and South America. Even though from a culinary point of view tomatoes are considered to be vegetables, [they are actually a fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato){:target="_blank"}.

Tomatoes mostly consist of water, but they also contain **sugars** and dietary fiber. Like other fruits, they **should be considered as a treat** for your rabbit. This means that they should be offered in limited quantities as feeding too much will lead to digestive troubles.

Make sure to rinse and discard any rotten fruits before presenting to your bunny. There is no need to peel the tomato as rabbits can also eat the skin and the seeds without a problem. We recommend feeding a rabbit **no more than a few slices of tomato per day**.

Although rabbits can eat tomatoes, **they should not be fed stems, vines, leaves, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant**. The reason for this is that the tomato plant is part of the [nightshade family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae){:target="_blank"}. Many members of this plant family contain potent alkaloids, and some are highly **toxic**.

However, we are not able to conclude that by default the tomato plant is toxic for all rabbits. It really seems to depend on the tomato plant and on the rabbit. We even came across [accounts](http://rabbittalk.com/should-rabbits-eat-tomato-greens-t4411.html#p43266){:target="_blank"} where people state they have fed tomato plants to their rabbits without any problems. **Our advice is to not take the risk and only feed the actual fruit**.

_To sum up, yes rabbits can eat tomatoes, but only the ripe ones and in small amounts._

## Can Rabbits Eat Strawberries? - *In Small Amounts*{:.orange}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/strawberries.jpg" alt="strawberries" class="align-right">

Strawberries are cultivated worldwide and are known for their [bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry){:target="_blank"}. They are a popular fruit and not just among us humans. The low-lying strawberry plants are actually easy for wild rabbits to reach, something fruit and vegetable garden owners might know only too well.

In addition to **sugar** and some dietary fibers, strawberries are an excellent source of vitamin C. The fact that they are rich in sugar also means they **are to be considered as a treat** for your fluffy friend. Too many strawberries may lead to stomach troubles.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaBWS-M39hM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you're wondering whether your rabbit can also eat the **strawberry tops** or even the **strawberry leaves** then the answer is yes. **They can actually eat any part of the plant**, just make sure to clean with streaming water before feeding.

As with all fruit, portion control is key in order to ensure a healthy diet. As a general rule of thumb, don't offer more than **a strawberry per day per rabbit** and alternate with other fruits. If it's the first time offering the treat to your bunny, then introduce slowly.

_Bottom line, strawberries are a great occasional treat for your rabbit._

## Can Rabbits Eat Watermelon? - *In Small Amounts*{:.orange}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/watermelon.jpg" alt="watermelon" class="align-right">

Watermelons originally come from Africa and are actually a special kind of berry called [pepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_%28botany%29#Modified_berries){:target="_blank"}. They are known for their smooth rind, which is the tough outer skin, usually green with dark green stripes.

A watermelon is more than 91 percent water. In addition to **sugar**, it also contains vitamin C in moderate quantity. Because of the sugar, watermelon **should be seen as a treat**.

Aside from the interior flesh, the **watermelon rind is also safe** for bunnies to eat. When it comes to the watermelon seeds, we haven't come across any reference saying that they are poisonous for rabbits. Just to be on the safe side we advise that you **remove the seeds** before feeding.

Limit portions to about **one inch (= 2.5cm) cubes per rabbit per day**. As watermelon juice is quite sticky, offer pieces they can easily eat in order to avoid their fur getting dirty. When offering for the first time be sure to start with a small amount to see your bunnies reaction.

_Rabbits can have watermelon but don't let them have too much._

## Can Rabbits Eat Bananas? - *In Small Amounts*{:.orange}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/bananas.jpg" alt="bananas" class="align-right">

The banana is an edible fruit, that from a botanical point of view, is actually a berry. While the [original wild bananas contain large seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#Modern_cultivation){:target="_blank"}, bananas for human consumption are grown asexually from offshoots and have tiny infertile black specks where the seeds used to be.

Practically every banana consumed in the western world is directly descended from a plant that was grown in the Derbyshire estate's hothouse 180 years ago. They are commonly referred to as [Cavendish group bananas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#Cavendish){:target="_blank"}, named after William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire.

Bananas contain quite **a lot of starch and sugar** in addition to being a good source of vitamin B. Because of their high sugar content they are to be seen as a **treat** that should **only be offered in very small quantities** to your rabbit.

Contrary to what you might think, the peel of a banana is actually edible for both us humans and your rabbit. Our advice is to **only feed the peel of organic bananas** which are not treated with pesticides. This opposite to [industrial banana farming which is typically pesticide-intensive](http://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2014/04/bananas){:target="_blank"} as bananas are grown in massive monocultures, without crop rotation.

Offer your bunny **no more than 2 to 3 slices of banana per rabbit per day**. It is especially important to keep the quantities small as your long eared friend's intestines are designed to digest grass and not food products high in carbohydrates (starch and sugar) like the banana.

_Even though your bunny will most likely go banana's over this treat, be careful to only offer it in very limited quantities._

## Can Rabbits Eat Cabbage? - *Sure*{:.green}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/cabbage.jpg" alt="cabbage" class="align-right">

Cabbage is a [multi-layered vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage){:target="_blank"}, grown for its dense-leaved head. Within the cabbage family, there are three main cultivar groups: **savoy cabbage, red cabbage, and white cabbage**.

In addition to dietary fiber, cabbage leaves are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin C.

Although they qualify as leafy greens, **cabbages should not be continuously fed to your rabbit**. The reason for this is that [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2062672/){:target="_blank"} have shown that feeding rabbits daily rations of cabbage can cause enlargement of the thyroid. This is a large ductless gland in the neck which secretes hormones that regulate growth and development. However, **with normal feeding in which leafy greens are regularly rotated, there is no cause for concern** in feeding this nutritious food.

We also came across some [accounts](http://www.binkybunny.com/FORUM/tabid/54/aft/124444/Default.aspx){:target="_blank"} that mention cabbage might cause gas with rabbits. This assumption is probably based on the fact that [people often get gas from cruciferous vegetables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence#Cause){:target="_blank"} like cabbage. We were not able to find scientific evidence to support this statement in the case of rabbits. Actually, **it is foods that are high in starch and sugars that are more likely to throw off a rabbit's gastrointestinal tract**. Also, some rabbits will be more sensitive to certain vegetables than others.

Based on the above, we advise to **include cabbage in your rabbits diet**. Just make sure **to regulary rotate**. If it's the first time, introduce in small amounts and rinse before offering.

_This was a tricky one, rabbits can eat cabbage leaves but remember to alternate with other greens._

## Can Rabbits Eat Broccoli - *In Lesser Amounts*{:.blue}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/broccoli.jpg" alt="broccoli" class="align-right">

Broccoli is an edible green plant in the [cabbage family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli){:target="_blank"}. It has large flower-heads which consist out of tight clusters of buds, usually green in color, with thick and edible stems. When sold, broccoli is often wrapped in cellophane as it deteriorates faster if it is in contact with the air.

Broccoli is an excellent source of vitamin C and K and it also contains moderate amounts of several B vitamins. Because the **flower and stalk parts are higher in starch and sugars** we recommend only offering them in **lesser amounts** to your rabbit.

Although the leaves are perfectly edible for us humans, broccoli is typically sold with only the flower and stalk parts of the plant. For bunnies, however, **the leaves are actually better** as they are not that high in starch or sugars compared to the rest of the plant. If you find a place that sells the whole plant you can also offer your rabbit those broccoli leaves in moderate amounts.

When doing our research we found a number of [references](http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-5/calcium.html){:target="_blank"} that mention **higher amounts of calcium** in **broccoli leaves** which could lead to [urinary/bladder problems](http://ontariorabbits.org/health/stones-and-sludge){:target="_blank"}. However, **calcium is an essential part of your rabbit's diet** as it is necessary for strong bones and teeth, so it should not be completely eliminated.

Given the fact that the amount of calcium in broccoli leaves is still relatively moderate, in most cases, there will be no reason for concern. **If you are in doubt about your rabbit's calcium intake**, our advice is to keep an eye on your rabbit's urine/fecal output and watch their behavior for signs of pain. If you notice something unusual **consult with your veterinarian**.

Broccoli belongs to the [genus Brassica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica){:target="_blank"} which is commonly reputed to increase flatulence with human beings. A rabbit's gastrointestinal tract, however, is not the same as a human's and because of this, we **can not automatically assume that broccoli is a "gassy" vegetable**. It is actually more likely that the higher amounts of starch and sugar in broccoli would cause gas in a rabbit as they change the pH of their digestive system.

Given that broccoli is higher in starch and sugars compared to leafy greens, we recommend you limit your rabbit to 2 or 3 florets and give them a good rinse before serving.

_So yes, rabbits can have broccoli, just not too much._

## Can Rabbits Eat Spinach? - *Sure*{:.green}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/spinach.jpg" alt="spinach" class="align-right">

Spinach is a [flowering plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinach){:target="_blank"} native to central and western Asia. Its leaves can be eaten as a vegetable and are a rich source of vitamins, iron, calcium and dietary fiber.

In contrary to most vegetables, spinach has **relatively high levels of oxalic acid**. When fed in large quantities, the salts of oxalic acid can accumulate in the system and cause toxicity over time.

This doesn't mean we advise to completely ban spinach from your bunny's diet. Given it is also a **good source of nutrients and fiber**, we recommend to feed spinach from time to time in combination with other greens. Take care to **not combine with greens that are also high on oxalic acids such as parsley, mustard greens, and clover**.

When picking spinach, select the lighter looking leaves as darker leaves indicate higher levels of oxalates. As far as portions are concerned, **limit to 1/3 of the daily fresh vegetables intake**. Clean by giving a good rinse under running water and feel free to serve wet to help with the daily water intake.

_Rabbits can eat spinach but make sure to not combine with other greens high on oxalates and rotate frequently._

## Can Rabbits Eat Oranges? - *In Small Amounts*{:.orange}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/oranges.jpg" alt="oranges" class="align-right">

[Oranges](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)){:target="_blank"} are a type of citrus fruit. The "sweet orange", which is the kind that is most often eaten today, grew first in Asia but now grows in many other parts of the world. Did you know that the color orange actually takes its name from the fruit?

Orange pulp is an excellent source of vitamin C. However, unlike us humans who have to get vitamin C through our diet, **rabbits produce their own vitamin C**. On top of that oranges are also [high on sugars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#Nutritional_value_and_phytochemicals){:target="_blank"} and as such you should present them to your rabbit **only as a treat**.

Keep portions small, **only one orange segment a day**. Rabbits generally love oranges. The first time offering, try giving a small piece. Chances are your bunny will play around with it for a while before tasting.

If you are wondering if rabbits **can also eat the orange peel** then the answer is yes. The peel is actually higher on fibers than the pulp. Just make sure to give it a good rinse before offering.

_To summarize rabbits can have oranges, even the peel. However, do keep the portions small._

## Can Rabbits Eat Cucumbers? - *In Lesser Amounts*{:.blue}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/cucumbers.jpg" alt="cucumbers" class="align-right">

[Cucumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber){:target="_blank"} is a widely cultivated plant in the gourd family. It is a creeping vine that bears fruits that are used as vegetables.

Raw cucumber (with peel) is **low on nutritional value** since it consists out of 95% water. The only notable nutrient it supplies in some quantity is vitamin K. 

**Rabbits can eat the peel, leaves, and seeds** of the cucumber plant. When serving, first rinse under some running water and then cut into smaller slices. In terms of portions, consider a couple of slices as part of the daily fresh vegetables.

Note that there is a **good change your bunny won't even like cucumbers**. It is listed as one of the [vegetables rabbits will not eat](https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/14929/what-vegetable-fruits-plants-will-rabbits-not-eat){:target="_blank"}. This is backed by a number of [accounts](http://www.binkybunny.com/FORUM/tabid/54/aft/138420/Default.aspx){:target="_blank"} we found where owners mentioned their rabbit avoids cucumber altogether.

_It's fine for rabbits to eat cucumbers. However, chances are your bunny might not like them._

## Can Rabbits Eat Asparagus? - *In Lesser Amounts*{:.blue}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/asparagus.jpg" alt="asparagus" class="align-right">

[Asparagus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagus){:target="_blank"} is a spring vegetable. It is considered a delicacy in the vegetable world and has a distinct, intense savory flavor.

As with a lot of vegetables, water makes up 93% of asparagus's composition. Other than that it is low in calories and a good source of dietary fiber.

You can offer your rabbit asparagus but **start with a small amount** if it's the first time feeding. Keep an eye on the stools and if everything looks normal you can add asparagus into the rotation of fresh vegetables that are part of your rabbit's diet.

There is a chance your bunny might not even like asparagus as it is listed as one of the [plants not usually eaten by rabbits](http://www.imustgarden.com/rabbit-resistant-plants){:target="_blank"}. We found some [accounts](http://www.binkybunny.com/FORUM/tabid/54/aft/108606/Default.aspx){:target="_blank"} that seem to confirm this statement. As every rabbit is different, just present it with a little bit of asparagus to find out.

Before serving, give the asparagus a good rinse under running water. Then cut or snap the stalk into 1 inch (=2.5cm) pieces and mix them in with the leafy greens. Keep portions small, give a couple of pieces per rabbit per day.

_Rabbits can eat asparagus, they just might not like it that much._

## Can Rabbits Eat Potatoes? - *Do Not Feed*{:.red}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/potatoes.jpg" alt="potatoes" class="align-right">

Potatoes are [tuberous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber){:target="_blank"} crops from the nightshade family. They were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Raw potatoes mainly consist out of water and **carbohydrates** (88% of which is [starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#Nutrition){:target="_blank"}).

A rabbit's digestive system is specialized for consuming large amounts of plants which are rich in fiber and low in fat. As a result, food types high on carbohydrates, like for example potatoes, **are likely to cause digestive upset**. When fed often, they may even lead to more serious health problems.

Feeding a little bit of potato isn't necessarily harmful to a rabbit. That being said it doesn't really have a positive impact in their diet either. As such we **recommend opting for other more beneficial treats**.

We did come across some [accounts](http://www.binkybunny.com/FORUM/tabid/54/aft/106992/Default.aspx){:target="_blank"} in which people mention they feed their rabbit a small amount of potato every day but this was based on veterinarian advice.

If you are wondering if rabbits can eat **sweet potatoes**, then the answer is that we also **advise against it**. Even though sweet potatoes are only distantly related to the potato and do not belong to the nightshade family, they are still packed with [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato#Nutrient_content){:target="_blank"} and contain more sugars than potatoes.

_Our advice is to not feed potatoes as there are plenty of other healthier treats you can offer your bunny._

## Can Rabbits Eat Bread? - *Do Not Feed*{:.red}

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/food/bread.jpg" alt="bread" class="align-right">

[Bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread){:target="_blank"} is prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. It has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods.

Bread contains plenty of carbohydrates, but other than that it offers **little nutritional value** for rabbits. In fact, a rabbit's digestive system is uniquely designed to consume large amounts of plant material. Feeding other types of food like for example bread can throw the whole digestive system out of balance. As a result, your bunny will probably have a **hard time digesting**.

In addition, when offering a rabbit a lot of bread, it can become overweight and inactive, which could lead to other health problems.

Technically, yes, rabbits can eat bread and a quick Internet search reveals a number of [accounts](http://forums.rabbitrehome.org.uk/showthread.php?172734-Is-brown-bread-really-bad-for-rabbits){:target="_blank"} where rabbit owners mention they (occasionally) feed their bunny a bit of bread. And although in most cases this will do no harm we suggest you **opt for the healthier treats like fruits**.

_In short, rabbits can eat bread but they shouldn't._
