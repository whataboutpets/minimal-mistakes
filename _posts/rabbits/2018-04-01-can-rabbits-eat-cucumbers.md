[Cucumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber){:target="_blank"} is a widely cultivated plant in the gourd family. It is a creeping vine that bears fruits that are used as vegetables.

# Do Rabbits Eat Cucumbers?

Raw cucumber (with peel) is **low on nutritional value** since it consists out of 95% water. The only notable nutrient it supplies in some quantity is vitamin K.

**Rabbits can eat the peel, leaves, and seeds** of the cucumber plant. When serving, first rinse under some running water and then cut into smaller slices. In terms of portions, consider a couple of slices as part of the daily fresh vegetables.

> There is a **good change your bunny won't even like cucumbers**. It is listed as one of the [vegetables rabbits will not eat](https://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/14929/what-vegetable-fruits-plants-will-rabbits-not-eat){:target="_blank"}. This is backed by a number of [accounts](http://www.binkybunny.com/FORUM/tabid/54/aft/138420/Default.aspx){:target="_blank"} we found where owners mentioned their rabbit avoids cucumber altogether.
