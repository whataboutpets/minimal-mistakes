# Do Rabbits Eat Oranges?

Orange pulp is an excellent source of vitamin C. However, unlike us humans who have to get vitamin C through our diet, **rabbits produce their own vitamin C**. On top of that oranges are also [high on sugars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#Nutritional_value_and_phytochemicals){:target="_blank"} and as such you should present them to your rabbit **only as a treat**.

Keep portions small, **only one orange segment a day**. Rabbits generally love oranges. The first time offering, try giving a small piece. Chances are your bunny will play around with it for a while before tasting.

# Can Rabbits Eat Orange Peels?

If you are wondering if rabbits **can also eat the orange peel** then the answer is yes. The peel is actually higher on fibers than the pulp. Just make sure to give it a good rinse before offering.
