# Do Rabbits Eat Cabbage Leaves?

In addition to dietary fiber, cabbage leaves are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin C.

Although they qualify as leafy greens, **cabbages should not be continuously fed to your rabbit**. The reason for this is that [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2062672/){:target="_blank"} have shown that feeding rabbits daily rations of cabbage can cause enlargement of the thyroid. This is a large ductless gland in the neck which secretes hormones that regulate growth and development. However, **with normal feeding in which leafy greens are regularly rotated, there is no cause for concern** in feeding this nutritious food.

We also came across some [accounts](http://www.binkybunny.com/FORUM/tabid/54/aft/124444/Default.aspx){:target="_blank"} that mention cabbage might cause gas with rabbits. This assumption is probably based on the fact that [people often get gas from cruciferous vegetables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence#Cause){:target="_blank"} like cabbage. We were not able to find scientific evidence to support this statement in the case of rabbits. Actually, **it is foods that are high in starch and sugars that are more likely to throw off a rabbit's gastrointestinal tract**. Also, some rabbits will be more sensitive to certain vegetables than others.

Based on the above, we advise to **include cabbage in your rabbits diet**. Just make sure **to regulary rotate**. If it's the first time, introduce in small amounts and rinse before offering.

**Conclusion:** this was a tricky one, rabbits can eat cabbage leaves but remember to alternate with other greens.
